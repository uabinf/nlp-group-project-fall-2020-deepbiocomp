\section*{Conclusion}
	The answers or responses produced by our fine-tuned model support the relevance of the question in logic with cancer QA. Our model also highlights the effectiveness of combining text generative and long-former models for further model improvement. Our findings also show that relying on a restricted set of reliable answer sources can bring a plentiful improvement in domain-specific QA.
