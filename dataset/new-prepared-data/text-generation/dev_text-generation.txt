<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).<EOS>
<BOS>The factors that affect prognosis (chance of recovery) are different before and after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Before treatment, prognosis depends on: Whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Where in the body the tumor started.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor formed in the bone or in soft tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>How large the tumor is at when the tumor is diagnosed.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the LDH level in the blood is higher than normal.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor has certain gene changes.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the child is younger than 15 years.<EOS>
<BOS>The patient's gender.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>After treatment, prognosis is affected by: Whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>If the cancer recurs after initial treatment, prognosis depends on: Whether the cancer came back more than two years after the initial treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Where in the body the tumor came back.<EOS>
<BOS>The type of initial treatment given.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of ovarian germ cell tumor are swelling of the abdomen or vaginal bleeding after menopause.<EOS>
<BOS>Ovarian germ cell tumors can be hard to diagnose (find) early.<EOS>
<BOS>Often there are no symptoms in the early stages, but tumors may be found during regular gynecologic exams (checkups).<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you have either of the following: Swollen abdomen without weight gain in other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Bleeding from the vagina after menopause (when you are no longer having menstrual periods).<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for children with brain stem glioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with brain stem glioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Six types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Cerebrospinal fluid diversion Observation Targeted therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for children with brain stem glioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for children with brain stem glioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with brain stem glioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include the following specialists: Pediatrician.<EOS>
<BOS>Neurosurgeon.<EOS>
<BOS>Neuropathologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation oncologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Neurooncologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Neurologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Rehabilitation specialist.<EOS>

<BOS>Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.<EOS>
<BOS>Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>These are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects may include the following: Physical problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).<EOS>
<BOS>Six types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat childhood brain stem glioma as discussed in the General Information section of this summary.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat DIPG.<EOS>
<BOS>External and/or internal radiation therapy may be used to treat focal brain stem gliomas.<EOS>
<BOS>Several months after radiation therapy to the brain, imaging tests may show changes to the brain tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>These changes may be caused by the radiation therapy or may mean the tumor is growing.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to be sure the tumor is growing before any more treatment is given.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and brain development in young children, clinical trials are studying ways of using chemotherapy to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Cerebrospinal fluid diversion Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up in the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>A shunt (long, thin tube) is placed in a ventricle (fluidfilled space) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Some focal brain stem gliomas that cannot be removed by surgery may be treated with BRAF kinase inhibitor therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>BRAF kinase inhibitors block the BRAF protein.<EOS>
<BOS>BRAF proteins help control cell growth and may be mutated (changed) in some types of brain stem glioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Blocking mutated BRAF kinase proteins may help keep cancer cells from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>If the results of imaging tests done after treatment show a mass in the brain, a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing.<EOS>
<BOS>In children who are expected to live a long time, regular MRIs may be done to see if the cancer has come back.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma Newly Diagnosed Childhood Brain Stem Glioma Newly diagnosed childhood brain stem glioma is a tumor for which no treatment has been given.<EOS>
<BOS>The child may have received drugs or treatment to relieve signs or symptoms caused by the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Standard treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) may include the following: Radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy (in infants).<EOS>
<BOS>Standard treatment of focal glioma may include the following: Surgery that may be followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Observation for small tumors that grow slowly.<EOS>
<BOS>Cerebrospinal fluid diversion may be done when there is extra fluid in the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy with radioactive seeds, with or without chemotherapy, when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy with a BRAF kinase inhibitor, for certain tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment of brain stem glioma in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 may be observation.<EOS>

<BOS>General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Progressive or Recurrent Childhood Brain Stem Glioma When cancer does not get better with treatment or comes back, palliative care is an important part of the child's treatment plan.<EOS>
<BOS>It includes physical, psychological, social, and spiritual support for the child and family.<EOS>
<BOS>The goal of palliative care is to help control symptoms and give the child the best quality of life possible.<EOS>
<BOS>Parents may not be sure about whether to continue treatment or what kind of treatment is best for their child.<EOS>
<BOS>The healthcare team can give parents information to help them make these decisions.<EOS>
<BOS>There is no standard treatment for progressive or recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.<EOS>

<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used to treat men with breast cancer: Surgery Surgery for men with breast cancer is usually a modified radical mastectomy (removal of the breast, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes part of the chest wall muscles).<EOS>
<BOS>Breastconserving surgery, an operation to remove the cancer but not the breast itself, is also used for some men with breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>A lumpectomy is done to remove the tumor (lump) and a small amount of normal tissue around it.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>

<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat male breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat men with breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are also used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy (treatment given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back).<EOS>
<BOS>Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for male breast cancer may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options for Male Breast Cancer Initial Surgery Treatment for men diagnosed with breast cancer is usually modified radical mastectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>Breastconserving surgery with lumpectomy may be used for some men.<EOS>
<BOS>Adjuvant Therapy Therapy given after an operation when cancer cells can no longer be seen is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted therapy after surgery, to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left.<EOS>
<BOS>Nodenegative: For men whose cancer is nodenegative (cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy should be considered on the same basis as for a woman with breast cancer because there is no evidence that response to therapy is different for men and women.<EOS>
<BOS>Nodepositive: For men whose cancer is nodepositive (cancer has spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy may include the following: Chemotherapy plus tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen).<EOS>
<BOS>Other hormone therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab).<EOS>
<BOS>These treatments appear to increase survival in men as they do in women.<EOS>
<BOS>The patients response to hormone therapy depends on whether there are hormone receptors (proteins) in the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Most breast cancers in men have these receptors.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy is usually recommended for male breast cancer patients, but it can have many side effects, including hot flashes and impotence (the inability to have an erection adequate for sexual intercourse).<EOS>
<BOS>Distant Metastases Treatment for men with distant metastases (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) may be hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or both.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy may include the following: Orchiectomy (the removal of the testicles to decrease the amount of hormone made).<EOS>
<BOS>Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist with or without total androgen blockade (to decrease the the amount of sex hormones made).<EOS>
<BOS>Tamoxifen for cancer that is estrogenreceptor positive.<EOS>
<BOS>Progestin (a female hormone made in a laboratory).<EOS>
<BOS>Aromatase inhibitors (to decrease the amount of estrogen made).<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapies may be used in sequence (one after the other).<EOS>
<BOS>Standard chemotherapy regimens may be used if hormone therapy does not work.<EOS>
<BOS>Men usually respond to therapy in the same way as women who have breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with adult ALL.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases.<EOS>
<BOS>Four types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with ALL may have late effects after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with adult ALL.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of adult ALL is done in phases: Remission induction therapy: This is the first phase of treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow.<EOS>
<BOS>This puts the leukemia into remission.<EOS>
<BOS>Postremission therapy: This is the second phase of treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>It begins once the leukemia is in remission.<EOS>
<BOS>The goal of postremission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse.<EOS>
<BOS>This phase is also called remission continuation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy is usually given during each phase of therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS (brain and spinal cord), the cells are able to "find sanctuary" (hide) in the CNS.<EOS>
<BOS>Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses, intrathecal chemotherapy, and radiation therapy to the brain are able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS.<EOS>
<BOS>They are given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis.<EOS>
<BOS>Four types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>When used to lessen the chance leukemia cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord, it is called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>When used this way, it is called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing bloodforming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to treat some types of adult ALL.<EOS>
<BOS>These drugs block the enzyme, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to develop into more white blood cells (blasts) than the body needs.<EOS>
<BOS>Three of the drugs used are imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), dasatinib, and nilotinib.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>

<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with ALL may have late effects after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of treatment for ALL may include the risk of second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Regular followup exams are very important for longterm survivors.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Untreated Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Standard treatment of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the remission induction phase includes the following: Combination chemotherapy.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>There are several types of skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>The skin is the bodys largest organ.<EOS>
<BOS>It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D.<EOS>
<BOS>The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer).<EOS>
<BOS>The epidermis is made up of 3 kinds of cells: Squamous cells are the thin, flat cells that make up most of the epidermis.<EOS>
<BOS>Basal cells are the round cells under the squamous cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Melanocytes are found throughout the lower part of the epidermis.<EOS>
<BOS>They make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color.<EOS>
<BOS>When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment, causing the skin to tan, or darken.<EOS>
<BOS>The dermis contains blood and lymph vessels, hair follicles, and glands.<EOS>
<BOS>See the following PDQ summaries for more information about skin cancer: Skin Cancer Screening Skin Cancer Treatment Melanoma Treatment Genetics of Skin Cancer There are several types of skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The most common types of skin cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, which forms in the squamous cells and basal cell carcinoma, which forms in the basal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are also called nonmelanoma skin cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Melanoma, which forms in the melanocytes, is a less common type of skin cancer that grows and spreads quickly.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in areas exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.<EOS>
<BOS>Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of skin cancer in the United States.<EOS>
<BOS>The number of new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer appears to be increasing every year.<EOS>
<BOS>These nonmelanoma skin cancers can usually be cured.<EOS>
<BOS>The number of new cases of melanoma has been increasing for at least 30 years.<EOS>
<BOS>Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure.<EOS>
<BOS>Finding and treating melanoma skin cancer early may help prevent death from melanoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis and treatment options depend on: The type of brain stem glioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Where the tumor is found in the brain and if it has spread within the brain stem.<EOS>
<BOS>The age of the child when diagnosed.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether or not the child has a condition called neurofibromatosis type 1.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>Tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood vascular tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps, lesions, or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>The picture can be printed to be looked at later.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose a vascular tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Health history affects the risk of developing colon cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for colorectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for colorectal cancer include the following: Having a family history of colon or rectal cancer in a firstdegree relative (parent, sibling, or child).<EOS>
<BOS>Having a personal history of cancer of the colon, rectum, or ovary.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a personal history of highrisk adenomas (colorectal polyps that are 1 centimeter or larger in size or that have cells that look abnormal under a microscope).<EOS>
<BOS>Having inherited changes in certain genes that increase the risk of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Having a personal history of chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease for 8 years or more.<EOS>
<BOS>Having three or more alcoholic drinks per day.<EOS>
<BOS>Smoking cigarettes.<EOS>
<BOS>Being black.<EOS>
<BOS>Being obese.<EOS>
<BOS>Older age is a main risk factor for most cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.<EOS>
<BOS>The cause of most childhood CNS germ cell tumors is not known.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.<EOS>
<BOS>Possible risk factors for brain stem glioma include: Having certain genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body, including electrolytes, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver function values.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time.<EOS>
<BOS>If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.<EOS>
<BOS>The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.<EOS>
<BOS>Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>The picture can be printed to be looked at later.<EOS>
<BOS>A biopsy is done to diagnose childhood nonHodgkin lymphoma: Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Because treatment depends on the type of nonHodgkin lymphoma, biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing childhood nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>One of the following types of biopsies may be done: Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lymph node or lump of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump, lymph node, or sample of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Core biopsy : The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a wide needle.<EOS>
<BOS>Fineneedle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a thin needle.<EOS>
<BOS>The procedure used to remove the sample of tissue depends on where the tumor is in the body: Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>A mediastinoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anterior mediastinotomy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>An incision (cut) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>A mediastinoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This is also called the Chamberlain procedure.<EOS>
<BOS>Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells: Immunohistochemistry : A laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Flow cytometry : A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface.<EOS>
<BOS>The cells are stained with a lightsensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light.<EOS>
<BOS>The measurements are based on how the lightsensitive dye reacts to the light.<EOS>
<BOS>Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.<EOS>
<BOS>FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization): A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues.<EOS>
<BOS>Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide.<EOS>
<BOS>When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide, they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of test is used to find certain gene changes.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell.<EOS>
<BOS>This test is used to diagnose specific types of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Hyperfractionated radiation therapy Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily dose of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day.<EOS>
<BOS>Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>

<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatments are available for patients with testicular cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Good Prognosis For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true: The tumor is found only in the testicle or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The levels of all the tumor markers are slightly above normal.<EOS>
<BOS>For seminoma, all of the following must be true: The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of alphafetoprotein (AFP) is normal.<EOS>
<BOS>Betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be at any level.<EOS>
<BOS>Intermediate Prognosis For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true: The tumor is found in one testicle only or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of any one of the tumor markers is more than slightly above normal.<EOS>

<BOS>hCG and LDH may be at any level.<EOS>
<BOS>Poor Prognosis For nonseminoma, at least one of the following must be true: The tumor is in the center of the chest between the lungs; or The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or The level of any one of the tumor markers is high.<EOS>
<BOS>There is no poor prognosis grouping for seminoma testicular tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery to remove the testicle (inguinal orchiectomy) and some of the lymph nodes may be done at diagnosis and staging.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the General Information and Stages sections of this summary.<EOS>
<BOS>) Tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat testicular cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>

<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Testicular Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Surveillance Surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results.<EOS>
<BOS>It is used to find early signs that the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>In surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Testicular Cancer for more information.<EOS>

<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle.<EOS>
<BOS>A patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away.<EOS>
<BOS>Longterm clinical exams are very important.<EOS>
<BOS>The patient will probably have checkups frequently during the first year after surgery and less often after that.<EOS>

<BOS>General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of immunotherapy: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment: CTLA4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check.<EOS>
<BOS>When CTLA4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell.<EOS>
<BOS>CTLA4 inhibitors attach to CTLA4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA4 inhibitor.<EOS>
<BOS>PD1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check.<EOS>
<BOS>When PD1 attaches to another protein called PDL1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell.<EOS>
<BOS>PD1 inhibitors attach to PDL1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD1 inhibitors.<EOS>
<BOS>Vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of targeted therapy: mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive.<EOS>
<BOS>Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are smallmolecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide.<EOS>
<BOS>MK1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Antibodydrug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibodydrug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: Age Family history of prostate cancer Race Hormones Vitamin E Folic acid Dairy and calcium The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: Folate Finasteride and Dutasteride The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: Selenium and vitamin E Diet Multivitamins Lycopene Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise.<EOS>
<BOS>Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: Age Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age.<EOS>
<BOS>The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.<EOS>
<BOS>Family history of prostate cancer A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higherthanaverage risk of prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Race Prostate cancer occurs more often in AfricanAmerican men than in white men.<EOS>
<BOS>AfricanAmerican men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormones The prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should.<EOS>
<BOS>The main male sex hormone is testosterone.<EOS>
<BOS>Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.<EOS>
<BOS>Testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by an enzyme in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Vitamin E The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.<EOS>
<BOS>Folic acid Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice.<EOS>
<BOS>Folic acid is a manmade form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as wholegrain breads and cereals.<EOS>
<BOS>A 10year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.<EOS>
<BOS>However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets.<EOS>
<BOS>Dairy and calcium A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: Folate Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice.<EOS>
<BOS>Folic acid is a manmade form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as wholegrain breads and cereals.<EOS>
<BOS>A 10year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets.<EOS>
<BOS>However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.<EOS>
<BOS>Finasteride and Dutasteride Finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body.<EOS>
<BOS>These drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT).<EOS>
<BOS>Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older.<EOS>
<BOS>This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>The number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups.<EOS>
<BOS>Men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts.<EOS>
<BOS>The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not.<EOS>
<BOS>The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not.<EOS>
<BOS>Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts).<EOS>
<BOS>The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: Selenium and vitamin E The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for AfricanAmerican men).<EOS>
<BOS>The study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Diet It is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>In the PCPT trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of highgrade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of highgrade prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Multivitamins Regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>However, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.<EOS>
<BOS>Lycopene Some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not.<EOS>
<BOS>It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>

<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body: Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, liver, and spleen, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>This imaging test checks for signs of cancer in the lung, liver, and spleen.<EOS>
<BOS>CD34 lymphocyte count: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of CD34 cells (a type of white blood cell).<EOS>
<BOS>A lower than normal amount of CD34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Eight types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Observation Hormone therapy Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs Targeted therapy Immunotherapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Gene therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatments are available for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with soft tissue sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include a pediatric surgeon with special training in the removal of soft tissue sarcomas.<EOS>
<BOS>The following specialists may also be included: Pediatrician.<EOS>

<BOS>Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.<EOS>
<BOS>Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of cancer treatment may include: Physical problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>) Eight types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery to completely remove the soft tissue sarcoma is done when possible.<EOS>
<BOS>If the tumor is very large, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called neoadjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>The following types of surgery may be used: Wide local excision: Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it.<EOS>
<BOS>Amputation: Surgery to remove all or part of the limb or appendage with cancer, such as the arm or hand.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphadenectomy: Removal of the lymph nodes with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Mohs surgery: A surgical procedure used to treat cancer in the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>Individual layers of cancer tissue are removed and checked under a microscope one at a time until all cancer tissue has been removed.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of surgery is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.<EOS>
<BOS>It is also called Mohs micrographic surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Hepatectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>A second surgery may be needed to: Remove any remaining cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Check the area around where the tumor was removed for cancer cells and then remove more tissue if needed.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer is in the liver, a hepatectomy and liver transplant may be done (the liver is removed and replaced with a healthy one from a donor).<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of radiation therapy may include the following: Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called stereotactic externalbeam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Most types of soft tissue sarcoma do not respond to treatment with chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.<EOS>
<BOS>Observation may be done when: Complete removal of the tumor is not possible.<EOS>
<BOS>No other treatments are available.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor is not likely to damage any vital organs.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.<EOS>
<BOS>Antiestrogens (drugs that block estrogen), such as tamoxifen, may be used to treat desmoidtype fibromatosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) that are commonly used to decrease fever, swelling, pain, and redness.<EOS>
<BOS>In the treatment of desmoidtype fibromatosis, an NSAID called sulindac may be used to help block the growth of cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do.<EOS>
<BOS>Kinase inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block an enzyme called kinase (a type of protein).<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of kinases in the body that have different actions.<EOS>
<BOS>ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading: Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block signals needed for tumors to grow: Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.<EOS>
<BOS>Pazopanib may be used to treat recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>It is being studied for many types of newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoidtype fibromatosis.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied such as LOXO101 and entrectinib for infantile fibrosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Other types of targeted therapy are being studied in clinical trials, including the following: mTOR inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive.<EOS>
<BOS>mTOR inhibitors are being studied to treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as cediranib, sunitinib, and thalidomide are being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Bevacizumab is being studied for blood vessel tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that work inside cancer cells and block signals needed for tumors to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>HMT inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Heatshock protein inhibitors block certain proteins that protect tumor cells and help them grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Ganetespib is a heat shock protein inhibitor being studied in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Antibodydrug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibodydrug conjugate being studied for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and synovial sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.<EOS>
<BOS>It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>

<BOS>Having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or HPV infection can affect the risk of vulvar cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of vulvar cancer include bleeding or itching.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the vulva are used to detect (find) and diagnose vulvar cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Vulvar cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the vulva.<EOS>
<BOS>Vulvar cancer forms in a woman's external genitalia.<EOS>
<BOS>The vulva includes: Inner and outer lips of the vagina.<EOS>
<BOS>Clitoris (sensitive tissue between the lips).<EOS>
<BOS>Opening of the vagina and its glands.<EOS>
<BOS>Mons pubis (the rounded area in front of the pubic bones that becomes covered with hair at puberty).<EOS>

<BOS>Vulvar cancer most often affects the outer vaginal lips.<EOS>
<BOS>Less often, cancer affects the inner vaginal lips, clitoris, or vaginal glands.<EOS>
<BOS>Vulvar cancer usually forms slowly over a number of years.<EOS>
<BOS>Abnormal cells can grow on the surface of the vulvar skin for a long time.<EOS>
<BOS>This condition is called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN).<EOS>
<BOS>Because it is possible for VIN to become vulvar cancer, it is very important to get treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or HPV infection can affect the risk of vulvar cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for vulvar cancer include the following: Having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN).<EOS>

<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>

<BOS>Most cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed before 1 year of age.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk factors for neuroblastoma are not known.<EOS>
<BOS>Neuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in nerve tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Neuroblastoma often begins in the nerve tissue of the adrenal glands.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney, in the back of the upper abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>The adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress.<EOS>
<BOS>Neuroblastoma may also begin in the abdomen, chest, spinal cord, or in nerve tissue near the spine in the neck.<EOS>
<BOS>Neuroblastoma most often begins during early childhood, usually in children younger than 5 years of age.<EOS>

<BOS>As children get older, the number of new cases decreases.<EOS>
<BOS>Neuroblastoma is slightly more common in males than females.<EOS>
<BOS>Neuroblastoma sometimes forms before birth but is usually found later, when the tumor begins to grow and cause symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>In rare cases, neuroblastoma may be found before birth, by fetal ultrasound.<EOS>
<BOS>The cause of most childhood brain and spinal cord tumors is unknown.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>

<BOS>A biopsy may result in retinal detachment (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye).<EOS>
<BOS>This can be repaired by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer: Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure Chemopreventive agents It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma: Sunscreen Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent skin cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise.<EOS>
<BOS>Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some studies suggest that being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of a persons skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun.<EOS>
<BOS>Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer: Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a fair complexion, which includes the following: Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.<EOS>
<BOS>Blue or green or other lightcolored eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>Red or blond hair.<EOS>
<BOS>Having actinic keratosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Past treatment with radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a weakened immune system.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to arsenic.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer: Having a fair complexion, which includes the following: Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.<EOS>
<BOS>Blue or green or other lightcolored eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>Red or blond hair.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.<EOS>
<BOS>Having several large or many small moles.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).<EOS>
<BOS>Having a family or personal history of melanoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Being white.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer: Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors.<EOS>
<BOS>This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.<EOS>
<BOS>Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.<EOS>
<BOS>It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following: Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.<EOS>
<BOS>Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemopreventive agents Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer: Beta carotene Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.<EOS>
<BOS>Isotretinoin High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.<EOS>
<BOS>However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Selenium Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Celecoxib A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.<EOS>
<BOS>Alphadifluoromethylornithine (DFMO) A study of alphadifluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo.<EOS>
<BOS>DFMO may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary.<EOS>
<BOS>Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) Studies have shown that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide.<EOS>
<BOS>More studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma: Sunscreen It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.<EOS>
<BOS>Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent skin cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI Web site.<EOS>
<BOS>Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for nonmelanoma skin cancer prevention trials and melanoma prevention trials that are now accepting patients.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult AML.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.<EOS>
<BOS>Other tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunophenotyping : A process used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell.<EOS>
<BOS>This process is used to diagnose the subtype of AML by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample.<EOS>
<BOS>A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell.<EOS>
<BOS>Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test (RTPCR): A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes.<EOS>
<BOS>This test is used to diagnose certain types of AML including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After lip and oral cavity cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lip and oral cavity or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for lip and oral cavity cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV After lip and oral cavity cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lip and oral cavity or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lip and oral cavity or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of the tests used to diagnose lip and oral cavity cancer are also used to stage the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the General Information section.<EOS>
<BOS>) There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if lip cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually lip cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic lip cancer, not lung cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for lip and oral cavity cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the lips and oral cavity.<EOS>
<BOS>These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I In stage I, cancer has formed and the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II In stage II, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters, and cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III In stage III, the tumor: may be any size and has spread to one lymph node that is 3 centimeters or smaller, on the same side of the neck as the tumor; or is larger than 4 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV Stage IV is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IVA, the tumor: has spread through tissue in the lip or oral cavity into nearby tissue and/or bone (jaw, tongue, floor of mouth, maxillary sinus, or skin on the chin or nose); cancer may have spread to one lymph node that is 3 centimeters or smaller, on the same side of the neck as the tumor; or is any size or has spread through tissue in the lip or oral cavity into nearby tissue and/or bone (jaw, tongue, floor of mouth, maxillary sinus, or skin on the chin or nose), and cancer has spread: to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters; or to more than one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters; or to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the neck as the tumor or on both sides of the neck, and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IVB, the tumor: may be any size and has spread to one or more lymph nodes that are larger than 6 centimeters; or has spread further into the muscles or bones in the oral cavity, or to the base of the skull and/or the carotid artery.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes anywhere in the neck.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IVC, the tumor has spread beyond the lip or oral cavity to distant parts of the body, such as the lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor may be any size and may have spread to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for uterine sarcoma: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV After uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The following procedures may be used in the staging process: Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.<EOS>
<BOS>Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder.<EOS>
<BOS>An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen and pelvis, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues to show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>Cystoscopy : A procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>A cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder.<EOS>
<BOS>A cystoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Surgery is used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>During this surgery, the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible.<EOS>
<BOS>The following procedures may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma: Laparotomy: A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Abdominal and pelvic washings: A procedure in which a saline solution is placed into the abdominal and pelvic body cavities.<EOS>
<BOS>After a short time, the fluid is removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Total abdominal hysterectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus and cervix through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>Bilateral salpingooophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>For a regional lymphadenectomy, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed.<EOS>
<BOS>For a radical lymphadenectomy, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called lymph node dissection.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment in addition to surgery may be given, as described in the Treatment Option Overview section of this summary.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if uterine sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually uterine sarcoma cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic uterine sarcoma, not lung cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for uterine sarcoma: Stage I In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatments are available for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery One or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma: Wide local excision: The cancer is cut from the skin along with some of the tissue around it.<EOS>
<BOS>A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done during the wide local excision procedure.<EOS>
<BOS>If there is cancer in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection also may be done.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>For a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed; for a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options by Stage Stage I and Stage II Merkel Cell Carcinoma Treatment of stage I and stage II Merkel cell carcinoma may include the following: Surgery to remove the tumor, such as wide local excision with or without lymph node dissection.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy after surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>A clinical trial of a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Check the list of NCIsupported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with stage I neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin and stage II neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a type of cancer that can damage tissue or cause lesions to form in one or more places in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Family history or having a parent who was exposed to certain chemicals may increase the risk of LCH.<EOS>
<BOS>The signs and symptoms of LCH depend on where it is in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin and nails Mouth Bone Lymph nodes and thymus Endocrine system Central nervous system (CNS) Liver and spleen Lung Bone marrow Tests that examine the organs and body systems where LCH may occur are used to detect (find) and diagnose LCH.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a type of cancer that can damage tissue or cause lesions to form in one or more places in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare cancer that begins in LCH cells (a type of dendritic cell which fights infection).<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes there are mutations (changes) in LCH cells as they form.<EOS>
<BOS>These include mutations of the BRAF gene.<EOS>
<BOS>These changes may make the LCH cells grow and multiply quickly.<EOS>
<BOS>This causes LCH cells to build up in certain parts of the body, where they can damage tissue or form lesions.<EOS>
<BOS>LCH is not a disease of the Langerhans cells that normally occur in the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>LCH may occur at any age, but is most common in young children.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment of LCH in children is different from treatment of LCH in adults.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatments for LCH in children and adults are described in separate sections of this summary.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of childhood AML usually has two phases.<EOS>
<BOS>Seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, or MDS.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Stem cell transplant Targeted therapy Other drug therapy Watchful waiting Supportive care New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>

<BOS>There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for children with AML, CML, JMML, or MDS.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include the following specialists: Pediatrician.<EOS>
<BOS>Hematologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Medical oncologist.<EOS>

<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Regular followup exams are very important.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>These are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of cancer treatment may include: Physical problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important that parents of children who are treated for AML or other blood diseases talk with their doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of childhood AML usually has two phases.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of childhood AML is done in phases: Induction therapy: This is the first phase of treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow.<EOS>
<BOS>This puts the leukemia into remission.<EOS>
<BOS>Consolidation /intensification therapy: This is the second phase of treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>It begins once the leukemia is in remission.<EOS>
<BOS>The goal of therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS (brain and spinal cord), the cells are able to find sanctuary (hide) in the CNS.<EOS>
<BOS>Intrathecal chemotherapy is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS.<EOS>
<BOS>It is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis.<EOS>
<BOS>Seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, or MDS.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>In AML, the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and/or spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat AML may not cross the bloodbrain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>Instead, chemotherapy is injected into the fluidfilled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there (intrathecal chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>In childhood AML, external radiation therapy may be used to treat a chloroma that does not respond to chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cell transplant Stem cell transplant is a way of giving chemotherapy and replacing bloodforming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Types of targeted therapy include the following: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>TKIs block the enzyme (tyrosine kinase) that causes stem cells to become more white blood cells (granulocytes or blasts) than the body needs.<EOS>
<BOS>TKIs may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy (treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back).<EOS>
<BOS>Imatinib is a type of TKI that is approved to treat childhood CML.<EOS>
<BOS>Sorafenib, dasatinib, and nilotinib are being studied in the treatment of childhood leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Gemtuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).<EOS>
<BOS>Gemtuzumab is not available in the United States unless special approval is given.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies may be used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Proteasome inhibitor therapy: Proteasome inhibitors break down proteins in cancer cells and kill them.<EOS>
<BOS>Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat childhood APL.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Other drug therapy Lenalidomide may be used to lessen the need for transfusions in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes caused by a specific chromosome change.<EOS>
<BOS>Arsenic trioxide and alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>These drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.<EOS>
<BOS>It is sometimes used to treat MDS or TMD.<EOS>
<BOS>Supportive care Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Supportive care may include the following: Transfusion therapy: A way of giving red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The blood may be donated from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Drug therapy, such as antibiotics or antifungal agents.<EOS>
<BOS>Leukapheresis: A procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed.<EOS>
<BOS>The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient's bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of biologic therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>NK cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells.<EOS>
<BOS>These may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>

<BOS>In electrochemotherapy, intravenous chemotherapy is given and a probe is used to send electric pulses to the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The pulses make an opening in the membrane around the tumor cell and allow the chemotherapy to get inside.<EOS>
<BOS>Electrochemotherapy is being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the Kaposi sarcoma lesions occur in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>In Kaposi sarcoma, chemotherapy may be given in the following ways: For local Kaposi sarcoma lesions, such as in the mouth, anticancer drugs may be injected directly into the lesion (intralesional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>For local lesions on the skin, a topical agent may be applied to the skin as a gel.<EOS>
<BOS>Electrochemotherapy may also be used.<EOS>
<BOS>For widespread lesions on the skin, intravenous chemotherapy may be given.<EOS>
<BOS>Liposomal chemotherapy uses liposomes (very tiny fat particles) to carry anticancer drugs.<EOS>
<BOS>Liposomal doxorubicin is used to treat Kaposi sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The liposomes build up in Kaposi sarcoma tissue more than in healthy tissue, and the doxorubicin is released slowly.<EOS>
<BOS>This increases the effect of the doxorubicin and causes less damage to healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Kaposi Sarcoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Interferon alfa is a biologic agent used to treat Kaposi sarcoma.<EOS>

<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.<EOS>

<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>

<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors form in hormonemaking cells (islet cells) of the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>Pancreatic NETs may or may not cause signs or symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.<EOS>
<BOS>Having certain syndromes can increase the risk of pancreatic NETs.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of pancreatic NETs have different signs and symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>Lab tests and imaging tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose pancreatic NETs.<EOS>
<BOS>Other kinds of lab tests are used to check for the specific type of pancreatic NETs.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors form in hormonemaking cells (islet cells) of the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side.<EOS>
<BOS>The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail.<EOS>
<BOS>The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas: Endocrine pancreas cells make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar.<EOS>
<BOS>They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans.<EOS>
<BOS>Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs).<EOS>
<BOS>Exocrine pancreas cells make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food.<EOS>
<BOS>Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>See the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment for information on exocrine pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called pancreatic endocrine cancer or islet cell carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.<EOS>
<BOS>Pancreatic NETs make different kinds of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon.<EOS>
<BOS>Functional pancreatic NETs include the following: Gastrinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make gastrin.<EOS>
<BOS>Gastrin is a hormone that causes the stomach to release an acid that helps digest food.<EOS>
<BOS>Both gastrin and stomach acid are increased by gastrinomas.<EOS>
<BOS>When increased stomach acid, stomach ulcers, and diarrhea are caused by a tumor that makes gastrin, it is called ZollingerEllison syndrome.<EOS>
<BOS>A gastrinoma usually forms in the head of the pancreas and sometimes forms in the small intestine.<EOS>
<BOS>Most gastrinomas are malignant (cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Insulinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make insulin.<EOS>
<BOS>Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>It moves glucose into the cells, where it can be used by the body for energy.<EOS>
<BOS>Insulinomas are usually slowgrowing tumors that rarely spread.<EOS>
<BOS>An insulinoma forms in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>Insulinomas are usually benign (not cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Glucagonoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make glucagon.<EOS>
<BOS>Glucagon is a hormone that increases the amount of glucose in the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>It causes the liver to break down glycogen.<EOS>
<BOS>Too much glucagon causes hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).<EOS>
<BOS>A glucagonoma usually forms in the tail of the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>Most glucagonomas are malignant (cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Other types of tumors: There are other rare types of functional pancreatic NETs that make hormones, including hormones that control the balance of sugar, salt, and water in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>These tumors include: VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide.<EOS>
<BOS>VIPoma may also be called VernerMorrison syndrome.<EOS>
<BOS>Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin.<EOS>
<BOS>These other types of tumors are grouped together because they are treated in much the same way.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of cancer that start in the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin color and being exposed to sunlight can increase the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis often appear as a change in the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests or procedures that examine the skin are used to detect (find) and diagnose nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>The skin is the bodys largest organ.<EOS>
<BOS>It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D.<EOS>
<BOS>The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer).<EOS>
<BOS>Skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells: Squamous cells: Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis.<EOS>
<BOS>Basal cells: Round cells under the squamous cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Melanocytes: Cells that make melanin and are found in the lower part of the epidermis.<EOS>
<BOS>Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its natural color.<EOS>
<BOS>When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to darken.<EOS>
<BOS>Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in skin that is often exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of cancer that start in the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>The most common types are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are nonmelanoma skin cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Melanoma is a much rarer type of skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>It is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Actinic keratosis is a skin condition that sometimes becomes squamous cell carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary is about nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis.<EOS>
<BOS>See the following PDQ summaries for information on melanoma and other kinds of cancer that affect the skin: Melanoma Treatment Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome Treatment Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment Merkel Cell Carcinoma Treatment Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment Genetics of Skin Cancer Nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis often appear as a change in the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>Not all changes in the skin are a sign of nonmelanoma skin cancer or actinic keratosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you notice any changes in your skin.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of nonmelanoma skin cancer include the following: A sore that does not heal.<EOS>
<BOS>Areas of the skin that are: Raised, smooth, shiny, and look pearly.<EOS>
<BOS>Firm and look like a scar, and may be white, yellow, or waxy.<EOS>
<BOS>Raised, and red or reddishbrown.<EOS>
<BOS>Scaly, bleeding or crusty.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Penile cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the penis.<EOS>
<BOS>Human papillomavirus infection may increase the risk of developing penile cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of penile cancer include sores, discharge, and bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the penis are used to detect (find) and diagnose penile cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Penile cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the penis.<EOS>
<BOS>The penis is a rodshaped male reproductive organ that passes sperm and urine from the body.<EOS>
<BOS>It contains two types of erectile tissue (spongy tissue with blood vessels that fill with blood to make an erection): Corpora cavernosa: The two columns of erectile tissue that form most of the penis.<EOS>
<BOS>Corpus spongiosum: The single column of erectile tissue that forms a small portion of the penis.<EOS>
<BOS>The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra (the tube through which urine and sperm pass from the body).<EOS>
<BOS>The erectile tissue is wrapped in connective tissue and covered with skin.<EOS>
<BOS>The glans (head of the penis) is covered with loose skin called the foreskin.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome have been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from the skin to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome: Stage I Mycosis Fungoides Stage II Mycosis Fungoides Stage III Mycosis Fungoides Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides Stage IV Szary Syndrome After mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome have been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from the skin to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread from the skin to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The following procedures may be used in the staging process: Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lymph nodes, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if mycosis fungoides spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually mycosis fungoides cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic mycosis fungoides, not liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome: Stage I Mycosis Fungoides Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB as follows: Stage IA: Less than 10% of the skin surface is covered with patches, papules, and/or plaques.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IB: Ten percent or more of the skin surface is covered with patches, papules, and/or plaques.<EOS>
<BOS>There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II Mycosis Fungoides Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB as follows: Stage IIA: Any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches, papules, and/or plaques.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph nodes are enlarged but cancer has not spread to them.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIB: One or more tumors that are 1 centimeter or larger are found on the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them.<EOS>
<BOS>There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III Mycosis Fungoides In stage III, nearly all of the skin is reddened and may have patches, papules, plaques, or tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them.<EOS>
<BOS>There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB as follows: Stage IVA: Most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches, papules, plaques, or tumors, and either: cancer has spread to lymph nodes and there may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood; or there are cancerous lymphocytes in the blood and lymph nodes may be enlarged, but cancer has not spread to them.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IVB: Most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches, papules, plaques, or tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to other organs in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them.<EOS>
<BOS>There may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV Szary Syndrome In stage IV: Most of the skin is reddened and covered with patches, papules, plaques, or tumors; and There is a high level of cancerous lymphocytes in the blood; and Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent endometrial cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>

<BOS>Signs and symptoms of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable, include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired.<EOS>
<BOS>Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable, is a disease that has features of both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative diseases but is not chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>In myelodysplastic /myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPDUC), the body tells too many blood stem cells to become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of these blood stem cells never become mature blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>These immature blood cells are called blasts.<EOS>
<BOS>Over time, the abnormal blood cells and blasts in the bone marrow crowd out the healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>MDS/MPNUC is a very rare disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Because it is so rare, the factors that affect risk and prognosis are not known.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Studies have shown that highdose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant does not work better than standard chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Doctors have decided that, for now, highdose chemotherapy should be tested only in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Before taking part in such a trial, women should talk with their doctors about the serious side effects, including death, that may be caused by highdose chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments for breast cancer may cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>These are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of radiation therapy are not common, but may include: Inflammation of the lung after radiation therapy to the breast, especially when chemotherapy is given at the same time.<EOS>
<BOS>Arm lymphedema, especially when radiation therapy is given after lymph node dissection.<EOS>
<BOS>In women younger than 45 years who receive radiation therapy to the chest wall after mastectomy, there may be a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of chemotherapy depend on the drugs used, but may include: Heart failure.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood clots.<EOS>
<BOS>Premature menopause.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancer, such as leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of targeted therapy with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or pertuzumab may include: Heart problems such as heart failure.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by retinoblastoma or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following: Pupil of the eye appears white instead of red when light shines into it.<EOS>
<BOS>This may be seen in flash photographs of the child.<EOS>
<BOS>Eyes appear to be looking in different directions (lazy eye).<EOS>
<BOS>Pain or redness in the eye.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Biologic therapy Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for children with Wilms and other childhood kidney tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Your child's treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include the following specialists: Pediatrician.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric surgeon or urologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation oncologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Rehabilitation specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric nurse specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Social worker.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: Physical problems, such as heart problems, kidney problems, or problems during pregnancy.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer), such as cancer of the gastrointestinal tract or breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary about Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are being done to find out if lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation can be used to lessen the late effects of treatment without changing how well the treatment works.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Two types of surgery are used to treat kidney tumors: Nephrectomy: Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are usually treated with nephrectomy (surgery to remove the whole kidney).<EOS>
<BOS>Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed and checked for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes a kidney transplant (surgery to remove the kidney and replace it with a kidney from a donor) is done when the cancer is in both kidneys and the kidneys are not working well.<EOS>
<BOS>Partial nephrectomy: If cancer is found in both kidneys or is likely to spread to both kidneys, surgery may include a partial nephrectomy (removal of the cancer in the kidney and a small amount of normal tissue around it).<EOS>
<BOS>Partial nephrectomy is done to keep as much of the kidney working as possible.<EOS>
<BOS>A partial nephrectomy is also called renalsparing surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk of the cancer coming back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes, a secondlook surgery is done to see if cancer remains after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether a biopsy was done before surgery to remove the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Systemic chemotherapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes the tumor cannot be removed by surgery for one of the following reasons: The tumor is too close to important organs or blood vessels.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor is too large to remove.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer is in both kidneys.<EOS>
<BOS>There is a blood clot in the vessels near the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>The patient has trouble breathing because cancer has spread to the lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>In this case, a biopsy is done first.<EOS>
<BOS>Then chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy is given after surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Cancers for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Interferon and interleukin2 (IL2) are types of biologic therapy used to treat childhood renal cell cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.<EOS>
<BOS>IL2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be used to treat recurrent Wilms tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points Oropharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the oropharynx.<EOS>
<BOS>Smoking or being infected with human papillomavirus can increase the risk of oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal cancer include a lump in the neck and a sore throat.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to help detect (find), diagnose, and stage oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Oropharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the oropharynx.<EOS>
<BOS>The oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx (throat), behind the mouth.<EOS>
<BOS>The pharynx is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose and ends where the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (tube from the throat to the stomach) begin.<EOS>
<BOS>Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or the esophagus.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.<EOS>
<BOS>Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.<EOS>
<BOS>Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.<EOS>
<BOS>The colon is part of the body's digestive system.<EOS>
<BOS>The digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The digestive system is made up of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines.<EOS>
<BOS>The colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long.<EOS>
<BOS>Together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6 to 8 inches long.<EOS>
<BOS>The anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body).<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer that affects either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>See the following PDQ summaries for more information about colorectal cancer: Colorectal Cancer Screening Colon Cancer Treatment Rectal Cancer Treatment Genetics of Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.<EOS>
<BOS>The number of new colorectal cancer cases and the number of deaths from colorectal cancer are both decreasing a little bit each year.<EOS>
<BOS>However, in adults younger than 50 years, the number of new colorectal cancer cases has slowly increased since 1998.<EOS>
<BOS>The number of new colorectal cancers and deaths from colorectal cancer are higher in African Americans than in other races.<EOS>
<BOS>Finding and treating colorectal cancer early may prevent death from colorectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Screening tests may be used to help find colorectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The purpose of treatment for polycythemia vera is to reduce the number of extra blood cells.<EOS>

<BOS>General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV After oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of some of the tests used to diagnose oropharyngeal cancer are often used to stage the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if oropharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually oropharyngeal cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic oropharyngeal cancer, not lung cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the oropharynx.<EOS>
<BOS>These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.<EOS>
