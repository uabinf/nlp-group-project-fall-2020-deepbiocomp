<BOS>Key Points Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).<EOS>
<BOS>Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of adult ALL include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult ALL.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).<EOS>
<BOS>Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; also called acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time.<EOS>
<BOS>A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.<EOS>
<BOS>A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>Granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.<EOS>
<BOS>A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells): B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.<EOS>
<BOS>T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.<EOS>
<BOS>In ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes.<EOS>
<BOS>These cells are also called leukemia cells.<EOS>
<BOS>These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>This may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).<EOS>
<BOS>This summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.<EOS>

<BOS>Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult ALL.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as infection or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: The number of red blood cells and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>The number and type of white blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests may be done on the samples of blood or bone marrow tissue that are removed: Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are looked at under a microscope to find out if there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, in Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL, part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called the Philadelphia chromosome.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunophenotyping : A process used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell.<EOS>
<BOS>This process is used to diagnose the subtype of ALL by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample.<EOS>
<BOS>A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different subtypes of AML.<EOS>
<BOS>Smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of adult AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult AML.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.<EOS>
<BOS>It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults.<EOS>
<BOS>AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time.<EOS>
<BOS>A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.<EOS>
<BOS>A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell.<EOS>
<BOS>A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>White blood cells that fight infection and disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>In AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts).<EOS>
<BOS>The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes in AML, too many stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>These abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets are also called leukemia cells or blasts.<EOS>
<BOS>Leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.<EOS>
<BOS>The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary is about adult AML.<EOS>
<BOS>See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia: Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment There are different subtypes of AML.<EOS>
<BOS>Most AML subtypes are based on how mature (developed) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML that occurs when parts of two genes stick together.<EOS>
<BOS>APL usually occurs in middleaged adults.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of APL may include both bleeding and forming blood clots.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include swollen lymph nodes and tiredness.<EOS>
<BOS>Usually CLL does not cause any signs or symptoms and is found during a routine blood test.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms may be caused by CLL or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.<EOS>
<BOS>Feeling very tired.<EOS>
<BOS>Pain or fullness below the ribs.<EOS>
<BOS>Fever and infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Weight loss for no known reason.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Six types of standard treatment are used: Targeted therapy Chemotherapy Biologic therapy Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) Surgery New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information about new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Six types of standard treatment are used: Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Imatinib mesylate, nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are used to treat CML.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing bloodforming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is a cancer treatment that may be used after stem cell transplant.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) from the stem cell transplant donor are removed from the donors blood and may be frozen for storage.<EOS>
<BOS>The donors lymphocytes are thawed if they were frozen and then given to the patient through one or more infusions.<EOS>
<BOS>The lymphocytes see the patients cancer cells as not belonging to the body and attack them.<EOS>
<BOS>Surgery Splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>

<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Immunotherapy Targeted therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>

<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Because rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different parts of the body, many different kinds of treatments are used.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include the following specialists: Pediatrician.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric surgeon.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation oncologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric hematologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric radiologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric nurse specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Geneticist or cancer genetics risk counselor.<EOS>
<BOS>Social worker.<EOS>
<BOS>Rehabilitation specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.<EOS>
<BOS>Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include: Physical problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>) Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>A type of surgery called wide local excision is often done.<EOS>
<BOS>A wide local excision is the removal of tumor and some of the tissue around it, including the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following: Where in the body the tumor started.<EOS>
<BOS>The effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look.<EOS>
<BOS>The effect the surgery will have on the child's important body functions.<EOS>
<BOS>How the tumor responded to chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may have been given first.<EOS>
<BOS>In most children with rhabdomyosarcoma, it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site.<EOS>
<BOS>Surgery to treat rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or genital areas is usually a biopsy.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, may be given before surgery to shrink large tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients will be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy may also be given.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>These types of external radiation therapy include the following: Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3dimensional (3D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3dimensional (3D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.<EOS>
<BOS>Volumetrical modulated arc therapy (VMAT): VMAT is type of 3D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) at the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT.<EOS>
<BOS>Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called stereotactic externalbeam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Proton beam radiation therapy: Protonbeam therapy is a type of highenergy, external radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positivelycharged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>It is used to treat cancer in areas such as the vagina, vulva, uterus, bladder, prostate, head, or neck.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy, internal radiation, implant radiation, or interstitial radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>The type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where in the body the tumor started, how much tumor remained after surgery, and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur.<EOS>
<BOS>The type of anticancer drug, dose, and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has lowrisk, intermediaterisk, or highrisk rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Previously Untreated Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma The treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the tumor started, the size of the tumor, the type of tumor, and whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Option Overview section of this summary for more information about surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy used to treat children with rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Rhabdomyosarcoma of the brain and head and neck For tumors of the brain: Treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>For tumors of the head and neck that are in or near the eye: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy.<EOS>

<BOS>Talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child.<EOS>
<BOS>General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of immunotherapy: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment: CTLA4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check.<EOS>
<BOS>When CTLA4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell.<EOS>
<BOS>CTLA4 inhibitors attach to CTLA4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA4 inhibitor.<EOS>
<BOS>PD1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check.<EOS>
<BOS>When PD1 attaches to another protein called PDL1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell.<EOS>
<BOS>PD1 inhibitors attach to PDL1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD1 inhibitors.<EOS>
<BOS>Vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of targeted therapy: mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive.<EOS>
<BOS>Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are smallmolecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide.<EOS>
<BOS>MK1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Antibodydrug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibodydrug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Diagnostic tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>Xrays : An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or abdomen, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>The picture can be printed to be looked at later.<EOS>
<BOS>If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma, a biopsy is done.<EOS>
<BOS>One of the following types of biopsies is usually used: Core needle biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure may be guided using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.<EOS>
<BOS>Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>An excisional biopsy may be used to completely remove smaller tumors that are near the surface of the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of biopsy is rarely used because cancer cells may remain after the biopsy.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer cells remain, the cancer may come back or it may spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An MRI of the tumor is done before the excisional biopsy.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done to show where the original tumor is and may be used to guide future surgery or radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>The placement of needles or incisions for the biopsy can affect the success of later surgery to remove the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>If possible, the surgeon who will remove any tumor that is found should be involved in planning the biopsy.<EOS>
<BOS>In order to plan the best treatment, the sample of tissue removed during the biopsy must be large enough to find out the type of soft tissue sarcoma and do other laboratory tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Tissue samples will be taken from the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and other areas that may have cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to find out the type and grade of the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>Highgrade and midgrade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than lowgrade tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose, the tissue sample should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue samples: Molecular test : A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid.<EOS>
<BOS>A molecular test may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some soft tissue sarcomas.<EOS>
<BOS>Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for changes in the expression of certain genes.<EOS>
<BOS>When genes are expressed they make specific proteins that are needed for the structure, function, and monitoring of the bodys tissues and organs.<EOS>
<BOS>This test is done in order to identify the type of tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, tumor or other tissue is viewed under a microscope to look for changes in the chromosomes.<EOS>
<BOS>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a type of cytogenetic analysis.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunocytochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibody is usually linked to an enzyme or fluorescent dye that causes the cells that have that marker to become visible under a microscope.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of soft tissue sarcoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocytepredominant.<EOS>
<BOS>Age, gender, and EpsteinBarr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, part of the body's immune system.<EOS>
<BOS>The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases.<EOS>
<BOS>The lymph system is made up of the following: Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph nodes: Small, beanshaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.<EOS>
<BOS>Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>It is located on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.<EOS>
<BOS>Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply.<EOS>
<BOS>The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat.<EOS>
<BOS>The tonsils make lymphocytes.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin lymphoma and nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary is about the treatment of adult Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Adult NonHodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>) Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children.<EOS>
<BOS>Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); these patients require special treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>See the following PDQ summaries for more information: Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment AIDSRelated Lymphoma Treatment Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age.<EOS>
<BOS>However, treatment is different for pregnant women.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary includes information about treating Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocytepredominant.<EOS>
<BOS>Most Hodgkin lymphomas are the classical type.<EOS>
<BOS>The classical type is broken down into the following four subtypes: Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphocyterich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Three types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Surgery For pregnant patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment options also include: Watchful waiting Steroid therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant Monoclonal antibody therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the fetus.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes, the stage of the Hodgkin lymphoma, and the age of the fetus.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms, cancer, and pregnancy change.<EOS>
<BOS>Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and expertise in treating adult Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include the following specialists: Neurosurgeon.<EOS>
<BOS>Neurologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Rehabilitation specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation oncologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Endocrinologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Hematologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Other oncology specialists.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of second cancers and other health problems for many months or years after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>These late effects depend on the type of treatment and the patient's age when treated, and may include: Acute myelogenous leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer of the breast, bone, cervix, gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, lung, soft tissue, and thyroid.<EOS>
<BOS>Heart, lung, and thyroid disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Avascular necrosis of bone (death of bone cells caused by lack of blood flow).<EOS>
<BOS>Herpes zoster (shingles) or severe infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Depression and fatigue.<EOS>
<BOS>Infertility.<EOS>
<BOS>Hypogonadism (low levels of testosterone and estrogen).<EOS>
<BOS>Regular followup by doctors who are expert in finding and treating late effects is important for the longterm health of patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Three types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug.<EOS>
<BOS>When a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, it isn't possible to protect the fetus from being exposed to the chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester.<EOS>
<BOS>Vinblastine is an anticancer drug that has not been linked with birth defects when given in the second half of pregnancy.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat adult Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>For a pregnant woman with Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be postponed until after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the fetus.<EOS>
<BOS>If immediate treatment is needed, the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>However, lead used to shield the fetus may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Surgery Laparotomy is a procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer is found, the tissue or organ is removed during the laparotomy.<EOS>
<BOS>For pregnant patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment options also include: Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change.<EOS>
<BOS>Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old, so that the mother can begin treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Steroid therapy Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body by the adrenal glands and by reproductive organs.<EOS>
<BOS>Some types of steroids are made in a laboratory.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain steroid drugs have been found to help chemotherapy work better and help stop the growth of cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Steroids can also help the lungs of the fetus develop faster than normal.<EOS>
<BOS>This is important when delivery is induced early.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The use of lowerdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is also being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>

<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Early Favorable Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment of early favorable Hodgkin lymphoma may include the following: Combination chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy with radiation therapy to parts of the body with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy alone to areas of the body with cancer or to the mantle field (neck, chest, armpits).<EOS>

<BOS>Treatment Options for Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy Hodgkin Lymphoma During the First Trimester of Pregnancy When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy, it does not necessarily mean that the woman will be advised to end the pregnancy.<EOS>
<BOS>Each woman's treatment will depend on the stage of the lymphoma, how fast it is growing, and her wishes.<EOS>
<BOS>For women who choose to continue the pregnancy, treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the first trimester of pregnancy may include the following: Watchful waiting when the cancer is above the diaphragm and is slowgrowing.<EOS>
<BOS>Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old so the mother can begin treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy above the diaphragm.<EOS>
<BOS>(A lead shield is used to protect the fetus from the radiation as much as possible.<EOS>
<BOS>) Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs.<EOS>
<BOS>Hodgkin Lymphoma During the Second Half of Pregnancy When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy, most women can delay treatment until after the baby is born.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the second half of pregnancy may include the following: Watchful waiting, with plans to induce delivery when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old.<EOS>
<BOS>Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs.<EOS>
<BOS>Steroid therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy to relieve breathing problems caused by a large tumor in the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After adult nonHodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Stages of adult nonHodgkin lymphoma may include E and S.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for adult nonHodgkin lymphoma: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV Adult nonHodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>After adult nonHodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out the type of cancer and if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose nonHodgkin lymphoma are used to help make decisions about treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging process: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: The number of red blood cells and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>The number and type of white blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, lymph nodes, and liver, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.<EOS>
<BOS>The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.<EOS>
<BOS>For pregnant women with nonHodgkin lymphoma, staging tests and procedures that protect the baby from the harms of radiation are used.<EOS>
<BOS>These tests and procedures include MRI, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, lumbar puncture, and ultrasound.<EOS>
<BOS>An ultrasound exam is a procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Stages of adult nonHodgkin lymphoma may include E and S.<EOS>
<BOS>Adult nonHodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows: E: "E" stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond, but near, the major lymphatic areas.<EOS>
<BOS>S: "S" stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for adult nonHodgkin lymphoma: Stage I Stage I adult nonHodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage I and stage IE.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I: Cancer is found in one lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IE: Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II Stage II adult nonHodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage II and stage IIE.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II: Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIE: Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III Stage III adult nonHodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage III, stage IIIE, stage IIIS, and stage IIIE+S.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIE: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIS: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIE+S: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV adult nonHodgkin lymphoma, the cancer: is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen), and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ; or is found in the liver, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or lungs (other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas).<EOS>
<BOS>Adult nonHodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>See the General Information section for more information on the types of indolent (slowgrowing) and aggressive (fastgrowing) nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>NonHodgkin lymphoma can also be described as contiguous or noncontiguous: Contiguous lymphomas: Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are next to each other.<EOS>
<BOS>Noncontiguous lymphomas: Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are not next to each other, but are on the same side of the diaphragm.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After AIDSrelated lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Stages of AIDSrelated lymphoma may include E and S.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for AIDSrelated lymphoma: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV For treatment, AIDSrelated lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows: Peripheral/systemic lymphoma Primary CNS lymphoma After AIDSrelated lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment, but AIDSrelated lymphoma is usually advanced when it is diagnosed.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>The blood sample will be checked for the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase).<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, lymph nodes, and liver, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>

<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.<EOS>
<BOS>The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>The sample may also be checked for EpsteinBarr virus.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>

<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Stages of AIDSrelated lymphoma may include E and S.<EOS>
<BOS>AIDSrelated lymphoma may be described as follows: E: "E" stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond, but near, the major lymphatic areas.<EOS>
<BOS>S: "S" stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen.<EOS>

<BOS>Stage II: Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIE: Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III Stage III AIDSrelated lymphoma is divided into stage III, stage IIIE, stage IIIS, and stage IIIE+S.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIE: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIS: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIE+S: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV AIDSrelated lymphoma, the cancer: is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen) and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ; or is found in the liver, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or lungs (other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas).<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who are infected with the EpsteinBarr virus or whose AIDSrelated lymphoma affects the bone marrow have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the central nervous system (CNS).<EOS>
<BOS>For treatment, AIDSrelated lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows: Peripheral/systemic lymphoma Lymphoma that starts in the lymph system or elsewhere in the body, other than the brain, is called peripheral/systemic lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>It may spread throughout the body, including to the brain or bone marrow.<EOS>
<BOS>It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage.<EOS>
<BOS>Primary CNS lymphoma Primary CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).<EOS>
<BOS>It is linked to the EpsteinBarr virus.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymphoma that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time.<EOS>
<BOS>If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.<EOS>
<BOS>Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<EOS>
<BOS>The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube.<EOS>
<BOS>The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node.<EOS>
<BOS>The lymph node may be removed during an imageguided CT scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy.<EOS>
<BOS>One of the following types of biopsies may be done: Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lymph node.<EOS>
<BOS>Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lymph node.<EOS>
<BOS>Core biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.<EOS>
<BOS>Fineneedle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially ReedSternberg cells.<EOS>
<BOS>ReedSternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The following test may be done on tissue that was removed: Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell.<EOS>
<BOS>This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Proton beam radiation therapy Protonbeam therapy is a type of highenergy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positivelycharged particles of matter) to make radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for children with nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with nonHodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Six types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy Other drug therapy Phototherapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for children with nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for children with nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking part in a clinical trial should be considered for all children with nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with nonHodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with nonHodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include the following specialists: Pediatrician.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation oncologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric hematologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric surgeon.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric nurse specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Rehabilitation specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Psychologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Social worker.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: Physical problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>) Six types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood nonHodgkin lymphoma that has spread, or may spread, to the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>When used to lessen the chance cancer will spread to the brain, it is called CNS prophylaxis.<EOS>
<BOS>Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to chemotherapy by mouth or vein.<EOS>
<BOS>Higher than usual doses of chemotherapy may also be used as CNS prophylaxis.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for NonHodgkin Lymphoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of nonHodgkin lymphoma being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood nonHodgkin lymphoma that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant This treatment is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and then replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for NonHodgkin Lymphoma for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immunotoxins are three types of targeted therapy being used or studied in the treatment of childhood nonHodgkin lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>

<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>

<BOS>A childhood brain or spinal cord tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain or spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>There are many types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different areas of the brain or spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumors may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>They rarely spread into other tissues.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should.<EOS>
<BOS>Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs or symptoms and need treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS).<EOS>
<BOS>The brain controls many important body functions.<EOS>
<BOS>The brain has three major parts: The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>It is at the top of the head.<EOS>
<BOS>The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement.<EOS>
<BOS>The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head).<EOS>
<BOS>It controls movement, balance, and posture.<EOS>
<BOS>The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>It is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck).<EOS>
<BOS>The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating.<EOS>
<BOS>The spinal cord connects the brain with nerves in most parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back.<EOS>
<BOS>It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes.<EOS>
<BOS>These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones).<EOS>
<BOS>Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch.<EOS>
<BOS>Brain and spinal cord tumors are a common type of childhood cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Although cancer is rare in children, brain and spinal cord tumors are the third most common type of childhood cancer, after leukemia and lymphoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for children is usually different than treatment for adults.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information about the treatment of adults.<EOS>
<BOS>) This summary describes the treatment of primary brain and spinal cord tumors (tumors that begin in the brain and spinal cord).<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment of metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors is not covered in this summary.<EOS>
<BOS>Metastatic tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain or spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>The signs and symptoms of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every child.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms depend on the following: Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>How fast the tumor grows.<EOS>
<BOS>The child's age and development.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain and spinal cord tumors or by other conditions, including cancer that has spread to the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: Brain Tumor Signs and Symptoms Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting.<EOS>

<BOS>The signs and symptoms of brain stem glioma are not the same in every child.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms depend on the following: Where the tumor forms in the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the tumor and whether it has spread all through the brain stem.<EOS>
<BOS>How fast the tumor grows.<EOS>
<BOS>The child's age and development.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain stem gliomas or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: Loss of ability to move one side of the face and/or body.<EOS>
<BOS>Loss of balance and trouble walking.<EOS>
<BOS>Vision and hearing problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>There is no standard staging system for childhood brain stem glioma.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment is based on the following: Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has come back after treatment).<EOS>
<BOS>The type of tumor (either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or a focal glioma).<EOS>
<BOS>Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood CNS embryonal tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for CNS embryonal tumors include having the following inherited diseases: Turcot syndrome.<EOS>
<BOS>RubinsteinTaybi syndrome.<EOS>
<BOS>Nevoid basal cell carcinoma (Gorlin) syndrome.<EOS>
<BOS>LiFraumeni syndrome.<EOS>
<BOS>Fanconi anemia.<EOS>
<BOS>In most cases, the cause of CNS embryonal tumors is not known.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the brain, vision, and hormone levels are used to detect (find) childhood craniopharyngiomas.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function.<EOS>
<BOS>The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work.<EOS>
<BOS>This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.<EOS>
<BOS>Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen).<EOS>
<BOS>This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead).<EOS>
<BOS>Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The gadolinium collects around the tumor cells so they show up brighter in the picture.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood hormone studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, the blood may be checked for unusual levels of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).<EOS>
<BOS>TSH and ACTH are made by the pituitary gland in the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Childhood craniopharyngiomas are diagnosed and may be removed in the same surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Doctors may think a mass is a craniopharyngioma based on where it is in the brain and how it looks on a CT scan or MRI.<EOS>
<BOS>In order to be sure, a sample of tissue is needed.<EOS>
<BOS>One of the following types of biopsy procedures may be used to take the sample of tissue: Open biopsy: A hollow needle is inserted through a hole in the skull into the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Computerguided needle biopsy: A hollow needle guided by a computer is inserted through a small hole in the skull into the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Transsphenoidal biopsy: Instruments are inserted through the nose and sphenoid bone (a butterflyshaped bone at the base of the skull) and into the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for tumor cells.<EOS>
<BOS>If tumor cells are found, as much tumor as safely possible may be removed during the same surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>The following laboratory test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed: Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The signs and symptoms of childhood ependymoma are not the same in every child.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms depend on the following: The child's age.<EOS>
<BOS>Where the tumor has formed.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ependymoma or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: Frequent headaches.<EOS>
<BOS>Seizures.<EOS>

<BOS>Blurry vision.<EOS>
<BOS>Back pain.<EOS>
<BOS>A change in bowel function.<EOS>
<BOS>Trouble urinating.<EOS>
<BOS>Confusion or irritability.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on: Where the tumor has formed in the central nervous system (CNS).<EOS>
<BOS>Whether there are certain changes in the genes or chromosomes.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether any cancer cells remain after surgery to remove the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The type of ependymoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The age of the child when the tumor is diagnosed.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>Prognosis also depends on the type and dose of radiation therapy that is given.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>

<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>

<BOS>There are different types of childhood liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two main types of childhood liver cancer: Hepatoblastoma: Hepatoblastoma is the most common type of childhood liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>It usually affects children younger than 3 years of age.<EOS>
<BOS>In hepatoblastoma, the histology (how the cancer cells look under a microscope) affects the way the cancer is treated.<EOS>
<BOS>The histology for hepatoblastoma may be one of the following: Pure fetal histology.<EOS>
<BOS>Small cell undifferentiated histology.<EOS>
<BOS>Nonpure fetal histology, nonsmall cell undifferentiated histology.<EOS>
<BOS>Hepatocellular carcinoma: Hepatocellular carcinoma usually affects older children and adolescents.<EOS>
<BOS>It is more common in areas of Asia that have high rates of hepatitis infection than in the U.<EOS>
<BOS>S.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of two less common types of childhood liver cancer is also discussed in this summary: Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver: This type of liver cancer usually occurs in children between 5 and 10 years of age.<EOS>
<BOS>It often spreads all through the liver and/or to the lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>Infantile choriocarcinoma of the liver is a very rare tumor that starts in the placenta and spreads to the fetus.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor is usually found during the first few months of life.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, the mother of the child may be diagnosed with choriocarcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Choriocarcinoma is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease and needs treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Treatment summary for information on the treatment of choriocarcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary is about the treatment of primary liver cancer (cancer that begins in the liver).<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment of metastatic liver cancer, which is cancer that begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the liver, is not discussed in this summary.<EOS>
<BOS>Primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children.<EOS>
<BOS>However, treatment for children is different than treatment for adults.<EOS>
<BOS>See the PDQ summary on Adult Primary Liver Cancer Treatment for more information on the treatment of adults.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for hepatoblastoma depend on the following: The PRETEXT or POSTTEXT group.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lungs or certain large blood vessels.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer can be removed completely by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>How the cancer responds to chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>How the cancer cells look under a microscope.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the AFP blood levels go down after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred.<EOS>
<BOS>Age of the child.<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma depend on the following: The PRETEXT or POSTTEXT group.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer can be removed completely by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>How the cancer responds to chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>How the cancer cells look under a microscope.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the child has hepatitis B infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred.<EOS>
<BOS>For childhood liver cancer that recurs (comes back) after initial treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend on: Where in the body the tumor recurred.<EOS>
<BOS>The type of treatment used to treat the initial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Childhood liver cancer may be cured if the tumor is small and can be completely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Complete removal is possible more often for hepatoblastoma than for hepatocellular carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups: PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group II PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group III PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>After childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the liver, to nearby tissues or organs, or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>In childhood liver cancer, the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups are used instead of stage to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of the tests and procedures done to detect, diagnose, and find out whether the cancer has spread are used to determine the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Two grouping systems are used for childhood liver cancer: The PRETEXT group describes the tumor before the patient has treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The POSTTEXT group describes the tumor after the patient has treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups: The liver is divided into 4 sections.<EOS>
<BOS>The PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups depend on which sections of the liver have cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I In group I, the cancer is found in one section of the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>Three sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.<EOS>
<BOS>PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group II In group II, cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>Two sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.<EOS>
<BOS>PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group III In group III, one of the following is true: Cancer is found in three sections of the liver and one section does not have cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer is found in two sections of the liver and two sections that are not next to each other do not have cancer in them.<EOS>
<BOS>PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV In group IV, cancer is found in all four sections of the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if childhood liver cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually liver cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic liver cancer, not lung cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with liver cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of healthcare providers who are experts in treating this rare childhood cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Six types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Watchful waiting Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Ablation therapy Antiviral treatment New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatments are available for children with liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking part in a clinical trial should be considered for all children with liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with liver cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of healthcare providers who are experts in treating this rare childhood cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with liver cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>It is especially important to have a pediatric surgeon with experience in liver surgery who can send patients to a liver transplant program if needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Other specialists may include the following: Pediatrician.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation oncologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric nurse specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Rehabilitation specialist.<EOS>
<BOS>Psychologist.<EOS>
<BOS>Social worker.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of cancer treatment may include: Physical problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).<EOS>
<BOS>Six types of standard treatment are used: Surgery When possible, the cancer is removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Partial hepatectomy: Removal of the part of the liver where cancer is found.<EOS>
<BOS>The part removed may be a wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with a small amount of normal tissue around it.<EOS>
<BOS>Total hepatectomy and liver transplant: Removal of the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor.<EOS>
<BOS>A liver transplant may be possible when cancer has not spread beyond the liver and a donated liver can be found.<EOS>
<BOS>If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Resection of metastases: Surgery to remove cancer that has spread outside of the liver, such as to nearby tissues, the lungs, or the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Factors that affect the type of surgery used include the following: The PRETEXT group and POSTTEXT group.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether there is more than one tumor in the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has spread to nearby large blood vessels.<EOS>
<BOS>The level of alphafetoprotein (AFP) in the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor can be shrunk by chemotherapy so that it can be removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether a liver transplant is needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery, to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called neoadjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.<EOS>
<BOS>In hepatoblastoma, this treatment is only used for small tumors that have been completely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment using more than one anticancer drug is called combination chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of regional chemotherapy used to treat childhood liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube).<EOS>
<BOS>The drug is mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called transarterial chemoembolization or TACE.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated and the PRETEXT or POSTTEXT group.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated and the PRETEXT or POSTTEXT group.<EOS>
<BOS>Radioembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of internal radiation therapy used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>A very small amount of a radioactive substance is attached to tiny beads that are injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube).<EOS>
<BOS>The beads are mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Most of the radiation is trapped near the tumor to kill the cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life for children with hepatocellular carcinoma.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat hepatoblastoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Ablation therapy Ablation therapy removes or destroys tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of ablation therapy are used for liver cancer: Radiofrequency ablation: The use of special needles that are inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Highenergy radio waves heat the needles and tumor which kills cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiofrequency ablation is being used to treat recurrent hepatoblastoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Percutaneous ethanol injection: A small needle is used to inject ethanol (pure alcohol) directly into a tumor to kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Several treatments may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Percutaneous ethanol injection is being used to treat recurrent hepatoblastoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Antiviral treatment Hepatocellular carcinoma that is linked to the hepatitis B virus may be treated with antiviral drugs.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver and liver cancer that has come back.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the treatment group may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options for Childhood Liver Cancer Hepatoblastoma Treatment options for hepatoblastoma that can be removed by surgery at the time of diagnosis may include the following: Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by watchful waiting or chemotherapy, for hepatoblastoma with pure fetal histology.<EOS>

<BOS>For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child.<EOS>
<BOS>General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following risk factors may increase the risk of liver cancer: Hepatitis B and C Cirrhosis Aflatoxin The following protective factor may decrease the risk of liver cancer: Hepatitis B vaccine Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent liver cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise.<EOS>
<BOS>Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following risk factors may increase the risk of liver cancer: Hepatitis B and C Having chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C increases the risk of developing liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk is even greater for people with both hepatitis B and C.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, the longer the hepatitis infection lasts (especially hepatitis C), the greater the risk.<EOS>
<BOS>In a study of patients with chronic hepatitis C, those who were treated to lower their iron levels by having blood drawn and eating a lowiron diet were less likely to develop liver cancer than those who did not have this treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Cirrhosis The risk of developing liver cancer is increased for people who have cirrhosis, a disease in which healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The scar tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and keeps it from working as it should.<EOS>
<BOS>Chronic alcoholism and chronic hepatitis C are the most common causes of cirrhosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Aflatoxin The risk of developing liver cancer may be increased by eating foods that contain aflatoxin (poison from a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts, that have not been stored properly).<EOS>
<BOS>The following protective factor may decrease the risk of liver cancer: Hepatitis B vaccine Preventing hepatitis B infection (by being vaccinated for hepatitis B) has been shown to lower the risk of liver cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not yet known if it lowers the risk in adults.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent liver cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for liver cancer prevention trials that are now accepting patients.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis (chance of recovery) is affected by certain factors before and after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis of untreated osteosarcoma and MFH depends on the following: Where the tumor is in the body and whether tumors formed in more than one bone.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and where it has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>The type of tumor (based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope).<EOS>
<BOS>The patient's age and weight at diagnosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor has caused a break in the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the patient has certain genetic diseases.<EOS>
<BOS>After osteosarcoma or MFH is treated, prognosis also depends on the following: How much of the cancer was killed by chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>How much of the tumor was taken out by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether chemotherapy is delayed for more than 3 weeks after surgery takes place.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has recurred (come back) within 2 years of diagnosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment options for osteosarcoma and MFH depend on the following: Where the tumor is in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The stage of the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the bones are still growing.<EOS>
<BOS>The patient's age and general health.<EOS>
<BOS>The desire of the patient and family for the patient to be able to participate in activities such as sports or have a certain appearance.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the stomach and intestines or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the carcinoid tumor is found and whether it can be removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>After a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the stomach and intestines or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of tests and procedures used to diagnose gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors may also be used for staging.<EOS>
<BOS>See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures.<EOS>
<BOS>A bone scan may be done to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if a gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually GI carcinoid tumor cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic GI carcinoid tumor, not liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the carcinoid tumor is found and whether it can be removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>For many cancers it is important to know the stage of the cancer in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>However, the treatment of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors is not based on the stage of the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment depends mainly on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the tumor has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment is based on whether the tumor: Can be completely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Has spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Has come back after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor may come back in the stomach or intestines or in other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Has not gotten better with treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Polycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.<EOS>
<BOS>Symptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.<EOS>
<BOS>Special blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera.<EOS>
<BOS>Polycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.<EOS>
<BOS>In polycythemia vera, the blood becomes thickened with too many red blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The number of white blood cells and platelets may also increase.<EOS>
<BOS>These extra blood cells may collect in the spleen and cause it to swell.<EOS>
<BOS>The increased number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the blood can cause bleeding problems and make clots form in blood vessels.<EOS>
<BOS>This can increase the risk of stroke or heart attack.<EOS>
<BOS>In patients who are older than 65 years or who have a history of blood clots, the risk of stroke or heart attack is higher.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients also have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia or primary myelofibrosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired.<EOS>
<BOS>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by CMML or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Fever for no known reason.<EOS>
<BOS>Infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Feeling very tired.<EOS>
<BOS>Weight loss for no known reason.<EOS>
<BOS>Easy bruising or bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis (chance of recovery) for atypical CML depends on the number of red blood cells and platelets in the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Hormone therapy Targeted therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following surgical procedures may be used: Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix.<EOS>
<BOS>If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>Bilateral salpingooophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.<EOS>
<BOS>Radical hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina.<EOS>
<BOS>The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Bevacizumab is used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>mTOR inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which helps control cell division.<EOS>
<BOS>mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell.<EOS>
<BOS>Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Metformin is being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options by Stage Stage I and Stage II Endometrial Cancer Lowrisk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2) Treatment of lowrisk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following: Surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy).<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy, with or without removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen) followed by internal radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>In certain cases, external radiation therapy to the pelvis may be used in place of internal radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot have surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>A clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer has spread to the cervix, a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy may be done.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for children with extracranial germ cell tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with extracranial germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Observation Chemotherapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>

<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Children with extracranial germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with extracranial germ cell tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include the following specialists: Pediatrician.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric surgeon.<EOS>
<BOS>Pediatric hematologist.<EOS>

<BOS>Geneticist.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: Physical problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancers (new types of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>For example, late effects of surgery to remove tumors in the sacrum or coccyx include constipation, loss of bowel and bladder control, and scars.<EOS>
<BOS>Some late effects may be treated or controlled.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).<EOS>
<BOS>Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery to completely remove the tumor is done whenever possible.<EOS>
<BOS>If the tumor is very large, chemotherapy may be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>A goal of surgery is to keep reproductive function.<EOS>
<BOS>The following types of surgery may be used: Resection: Surgery to remove tissue or part or all of an organ.<EOS>
<BOS>Radical inguinal orchiectomy: Surgery to remove one or both testicles through an incision (cut) in the groin.<EOS>
<BOS>Unilateral salpingooophorectomy: Surgery to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube on the same side.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.<EOS>
<BOS>For childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, this includes physical exams, imaging tests, and tumor marker tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>

<BOS>Age and gender can affect the risk of extragonadal germ cell tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of extragonadal germ cell tumors include breathing problems and chest pain.<EOS>
<BOS>Imaging and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose extragonadal germ cell tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Extragonadal germ cell tumors form from developing sperm or egg cells that travel from the gonads to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>" Extragonadal" means outside of the gonads (sex organs).<EOS>
<BOS>When cells that are meant to form sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries travel to other parts of the body, they may grow into extragonadal germ cell tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>These tumors may begin to grow anywhere in the body but usually begin in organs such as the pineal gland in the brain, in the mediastinum (area between the lungs), or in the retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen).<EOS>
<BOS>Extragonadal germ cell tumors can be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>Benign extragonadal germ cell tumors are called benign teratomas.<EOS>
<BOS>These are more common than malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors and often are very large.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors are divided into two types, nonseminoma and seminoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Nonseminomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas.<EOS>
<BOS>They usually are large and cause signs and symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>If untreated, malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors may spread to the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, liver, or other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about germ cell tumors in the ovaries and testicles, see the following PDQ summaries: Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment Testicular Cancer Treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of extragonadal germ cell tumors include breathing problems and chest pain.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors may cause signs and symptoms as they grow into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Chest pain.<EOS>
<BOS>Breathing problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Cough.<EOS>
<BOS>Fever.<EOS>
<BOS>Headache.<EOS>
<BOS>Change in bowel habits.<EOS>
<BOS>Feeling very tired.<EOS>
<BOS>Trouble walking.<EOS>
<BOS>Trouble in seeing or moving the eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma: Small Medium Large There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV After intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time.<EOS>
<BOS>If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.<EOS>
<BOS>The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma: Small The tumor is 5 to 16 millimeters in diameter and from 1 to 3 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>Medium The tumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and from 3.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 8 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>Large The tumor is: more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter.<EOS>
<BOS>Though most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat.<EOS>
<BOS>These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems.<EOS>
<BOS>The staging system used depends on where in the eye the cancer first formed: Iris.<EOS>
<BOS>Ciliary body and choroid.<EOS>
<BOS>If intraocular melanoma spreads to the optic nerve or nearby tissue of the eye socket, it is called extraocular extension.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris: Stage I In stage I, the tumor is in the iris only and is not more than one fourth the size of the iris.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIA, the tumor: is in the iris only and is more than one fourth the size of the iris; or is in the iris only and has caused glaucoma; or has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor has caused glaucoma.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIB, the tumor has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both, and has also spread into the sclera.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor has caused glaucoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIIA, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball.<EOS>
<BOS>The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIIB, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball.<EOS>
<BOS>The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is more than 5 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread: to nearby lymph nodes; or to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid: Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid is grouped into four size categories.<EOS>
<BOS>The category depends on how wide and thick the tumor is.<EOS>
<BOS>Category 1 tumors are the smallest and category 4 tumors are the biggest.<EOS>
<BOS>Category 1: The tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or the tumor is not more than 9 millimeters wide and 3.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 6 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>Category 2: The tumor is 12.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 18 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or the tumor is 9.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 15 millimeters wide and 3.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 6 millimeters thick; or the tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and 6.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 9 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>Category 3: The tumor is 15.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 18 millimeters wide and 3.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 6 millimeters thick; or the tumor is 12.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 18 millimeters wide and 6.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 9 millimeters thick; or the tumor is 3.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 18 millimeters wide and 9.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 12 millimeters thick; or the tumor is 9.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 15 millimeters wide and 12.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 15 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>Category 4: The tumor is more than 18 millimeters wide and may be any thickness; or the tumor is 15.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 18 millimeters wide and more than 12 millimeters thick; or the tumor is 12.<EOS>
<BOS>1 to 15 millimeters wide and more than 15 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I In stage I, the tumor is size category 1 and is in the choroid only.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIA, the tumor: is size category 1 and has spread to the ciliary body; or is size category 1 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball.<EOS>
<BOS>The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick.<EOS>
<BOS>The tumor may have spread to the ciliary body; or is size category 2 and is in the choroid only.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIB, the tumor: is size category 2 and has spread to the ciliary body; or is size category 3 and is in the choroid only.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.<EOS>

<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread: to nearby lymph nodes; or to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin.<EOS>
<BOS>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: Whether the cancer is in one or both eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>The size and number of tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the tumor has spread to the area around the eye, to the brain, or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether there are symptoms at the time of diagnosis, for trilateral retinoblastoma.<EOS>
<BOS>The age of the child.<EOS>
<BOS>How likely it is that vision can be saved in one or both eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether a second type of cancer has formed.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the medical research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for disease are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose disease has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's clinical trials database.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.<EOS>
<BOS>Being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain.<EOS>
<BOS>Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.<EOS>
<BOS>Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder.<EOS>
<BOS>The gallbladder is a pearshaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fat.<EOS>
<BOS>When food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine.<EOS>
<BOS>The wall of the gallbladder has 3 main layers of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Mucosal (inner) layer.<EOS>
<BOS>Muscularis (middle, muscle) layer.<EOS>
<BOS>Serosal (outer) layer.<EOS>
<BOS>Between these layers is supporting connective tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Primary gallbladder cancer starts in the inner layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.<EOS>
<BOS>Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.<EOS>
<BOS>Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons: There are no signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The symptoms of gallbladder cancer, when present, are like the symptoms of many other illnesses.<EOS>
<BOS>The gallbladder is hidden behind the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>Gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed for other reasons.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with gallstones rarely develop gallbladder cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain.<EOS>
<BOS>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by gallbladder cancer or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).<EOS>
<BOS>Pain above the stomach.<EOS>
<BOS>Fever.<EOS>
<BOS>Nausea and vomiting.<EOS>
<BOS>Bloating.<EOS>
<BOS>Lumps in the abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There is no staging system for hydatidiform moles.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for GTN: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV The treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease, stage, or risk group.<EOS>
<BOS>After gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out the extent or spread of cancer is called staging, The information gathered from the staging process helps determine the stage of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>For GTN, stage is one of the factors used to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be done to help find out the stage of the disease: Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.<EOS>
<BOS>The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if choriocarcinoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually choriocarcinoma cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic choriocarcinoma, not lung cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There is no staging system for hydatidiform moles.<EOS>
<BOS>Hydatidiform moles (HM) are found in the uterus only and do not spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for GTN: Stage I In stage I, the tumor is in the uterus only.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II In stage II, cancer has spread outside of the uterus to the ovary, fallopian tube, vagina, and/or the ligaments that support the uterus.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III In stage III, cancer has spread to the lung.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body other than the lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>The treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease, stage, or risk group.<EOS>
<BOS>Invasive moles and choriocarcinomas are treated based on risk groups.<EOS>
<BOS>The stage of the invasive mole or choriocarcinoma is one factor used to determine risk group.<EOS>
<BOS>Other factors include the following: The age of the patient when the diagnosis is made.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the GTN occurred after a molar pregnancy, miscarriage, or normal pregnancy.<EOS>
<BOS>How soon the tumor was diagnosed after the pregnancy began.<EOS>
<BOS>The level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The size of the largest tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Where the tumor has spread to and the number of tumors in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>How many chemotherapy drugs the tumor has been treated with (for recurrent or resistant tumors).<EOS>
<BOS>There are two risk groups for invasive moles and choriocarcinomas: low risk and high risk.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with lowrisk disease usually receive less aggressive treatment than patients with highrisk disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Placentalsite trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) treatments depend on the stage of disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the throat and neck are used to help detect (find), diagnose, and stage laryngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam of the throat and neck: An exam to check the throat and neck for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>The doctor will feel the inside of the mouth with a gloved finger and examine the mouth and throat with a small longhandled mirror and light.<EOS>
<BOS>This will include checking the insides of the cheeks and lips; the gums; the back, roof, and floor of the mouth; the top, bottom, and sides of the tongue; and the throat.<EOS>
<BOS>The neck will be felt for swollen lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and medical treatments will also be taken.<EOS>

<BOS>The sample of tissue may be removed during one of the following procedures: Laryngoscopy : A procedure to look at the larynx (voice box) for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>A mirror or a laryngoscope (a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) is inserted through the mouth to see the larynx.<EOS>
<BOS>A special tool on the laryngoscope may be used to remove samples of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body, such as the throat, esophagus, and trachea to check for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a light and a lens for viewing) is inserted through an opening in the body, such as the mouth.<EOS>
<BOS>A special tool on the endoscope may be used to remove samples of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>

<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.<EOS>
<BOS>Barium swallow : A series of xrays of the esophagus and stomach.<EOS>
<BOS>The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silverwhite metallic compound).<EOS>
<BOS>The liquid coats the esophagus and stomach, and xrays are taken.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called an upper GI series.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or throat that doesn't go away.<EOS>
<BOS>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.<EOS>
<BOS>Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of salivary gland cancer include a lump or trouble swallowing.<EOS>
<BOS>Salivary gland cancer may not cause any symptoms.<EOS>
<BOS>It may be found during a regular dental checkup or physical exam.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms may be caused by salivary gland cancer or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: A lump (usually painless) in the area of the ear, cheek, jaw, lip, or inside the mouth.<EOS>
<BOS>Fluid draining from the ear.<EOS>
<BOS>Trouble swallowing or opening the mouth widely.<EOS>
<BOS>Numbness or weakness in the face.<EOS>
<BOS>Pain in the face that does not go away.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Tobacco use Alcohol use Tobacco and alcohol use Betel quid or gutka chewing Personal history of head and neck cancer The following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer: HPV infection The following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Quitting smoking It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise.<EOS>
<BOS>Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are two different diseases, but they have some risk factors in common.<EOS>
<BOS>The following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Tobacco use Using tobacco is the most common cause of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of these cancers is about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked.<EOS>
<BOS>The use of all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) can cause cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx.<EOS>
<BOS>For cigarette smokers, the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.<EOS>
<BOS>Alcohol use Using alcohol is also an important risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about twice as high in people who have 3 to 4 alcoholic drinks per day and 5 times higher in people who have 5 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol.<EOS>
<BOS>Tobacco and alcohol use The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is 2 to 3 times higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 35 times higher in people who smoke 2 or more packs of cigarettes per day and have more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day than it is in people who have never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol.<EOS>
<BOS>Betel quid or gutka chewing Chewing betel quid or gutka (betel quid mixed with tobacco) has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancercausing substance.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with how long and how often betel quid or gutka are chewed.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is higher when chewing gutka than when chewing betel quid alone.<EOS>
<BOS>Betel quid and gutka chewing is common in many countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia, including China and India.<EOS>
<BOS>Personal history of head and neck cancer A personal history of head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer: HPV infection Being infected with certain types of HPV, especially HPV type 16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>HPV infection is spread mainly through sexual contact.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of oropharyngeal cancer is about 15 times higher in people who have oral HPV 16 infection compared with people who do not have oral HPV 16 infection.<EOS>
<BOS>The following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Quitting smoking Studies have shown that when people stop smoking cigarettes, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer decreases by one half (50%) within 5 years.<EOS>
<BOS>Within 20 years of quitting, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is the same as for a person who never smoked cigarettes.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>It has not been proven that stopping alcohol use will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Getting an HPV vaccination greatly lessens the risk of oral HPV infection.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not yet known whether getting an HPV vaccination at any age will decrease the risk of oropharyngeal cancer from HPV infection.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for oral cavity cancer prevention trials and oropharyngeal cancer prevention trials that are now accepting patients.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of some of the tests used to diagnose pancreatic cancer are often also used to stage the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>See the General Information section for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I In stage I, cancer has formed and is found in the pancreas only.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, based on the size of the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IA: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II In stage II, cancer may have spread to nearby tissue and organs, and may have spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, based on where the cancer has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby tissue and organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to nearby tissue and organs.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage III In stage III, cancer has spread to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, cancer may be of any size and has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lung, and peritoneal cavity.<EOS>
<BOS>It may have also spread to organs and tissues near the pancreas or to lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Chemoradiation therapy Targeted therapy There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery One of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the tumor: Whipple procedure: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed.<EOS>
<BOS>Enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and insulin.<EOS>
<BOS>Total pancreatectomy: This operation removes the whole pancreas, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, the common bile duct, the gallbladder, the spleen, and nearby lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Distal pancreatectomy: The body and the tail of the pancreas and usually the spleen are removed.<EOS>
<BOS>If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: Surgical biliary bypass: If cancer is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done.<EOS>
<BOS>During this operation, the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area.<EOS>
<BOS>Endoscopic stent placement: If the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area.<EOS>
<BOS>The doctor may place the stent through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine.<EOS>
<BOS>Gastric bypass: If the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemoradiation therapy Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Erlotinib is a type of TKI used to treat pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Pain can occur when the tumor presses on nerves or other organs near the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>When pain medicine is not enough, there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain.<EOS>
<BOS>The doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs.<EOS>
<BOS>Surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make pancreatic enzymes that help to digest food.<EOS>
<BOS>As a result, patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing nutrients into the body.<EOS>
<BOS>To prevent malnutrition, the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes.<EOS>
<BOS>See the PDQ summary on Nutrition in Cancer Care for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options by Stage Stages I and II Pancreatic Cancer Treatment of stage I and stage II pancreatic cancer may include the following: Surgery.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of the tests and procedures used to diagnose pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are also used to find out whether the cancer has spread.<EOS>
<BOS>See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures.<EOS>
<BOS>Although there is a standard staging system for pancreatic NETs, it is not used to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment of pancreatic NETs is based on the following: Whether the cancer is found in one place in the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer is found in several places in the pancreas.<EOS>
<BOS>Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas or to other parts of the body such as the liver, lung, peritoneum, or bone.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually neuroendocrine tumor cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, not liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Hormone therapy Targeted therapy New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Most patients with breast cancer have surgery to remove the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>It is the first lymph node where the cancer is likely to spread.<EOS>
<BOS>A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>After the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the tumor using breastconserving surgery or mastectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer cells were not found in the sentinel lymph node, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer cells were found, more lymph nodes will be removed through a separate incision.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called a lymph node dissection.<EOS>
<BOS>Types of surgery include the following: Breastconserving surgery is an operation to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself.<EOS>
<BOS>Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breastsparing surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Total mastectomy: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called a simple mastectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the lymph nodes under the arm may be removed and checked for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This may be done at the same time as the breast surgery or after.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done through a separate incision.<EOS>
<BOS>Modified radical mastectomy: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes, part of the chest wall muscles.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to remove the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>When given before surgery, chemotherapy will shrink the tumor and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given before surgery is called preoperative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy after surgery, to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called postoperative therapy or adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>If a patient is going to have a mastectomy, breast reconstruction (surgery to rebuild a breasts shape after a mastectomy) may be considered.<EOS>
<BOS>Breast reconstruction may be done at the time of the mastectomy or at some time after.<EOS>
<BOS>The reconstructed breast may be made with the patients own (nonbreast) tissue or by using implants filled with saline or silicone gel.<EOS>
<BOS>Before the decision to get an implant is made, patients can call the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiologic Health at 1888INFOFDA (18884636332) or visit the FDA website for more information on breast implants.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy with strontium89 (a radionuclide) is used to relieve bone pain caused by breast cancer that has spread to the bones.<EOS>
<BOS>Strontium89 is injected into a vein and travels to the surface of the bones.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation is released and kills cancer cells in the bones.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>Systemic chemotherapy is used in the treatment of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.<EOS>
<BOS>The hormone estrogen, which makes some breast cancers grow, is made mainly by the ovaries.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment to stop the ovaries from making estrogen is called ovarian ablation.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy with tamoxifen is often given to patients with early localized breast cancer that can be removed by surgery and those with metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body).<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy with tamoxifen or estrogens can act on cells all over the body and may increase the chance of developing endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Women taking tamoxifen should have a pelvic exam every year to look for any signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Any vaginal bleeding, other than menstrual bleeding, should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy with a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist is given to some premenopausal women who have just been diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>LHRH agonists decrease the body's estrogen and progesterone.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor is given to some postmenopausal women who have hormone receptor positive breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Aromatase inhibitors decrease the body's estrogen by blocking an enzyme called aromatase from turning androgen into estrogen.<EOS>
<BOS>Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are types of aromatase inhibitors.<EOS>
<BOS>For the treatment of early localized breast cancer that can be removed by surgery, certain aromatase inhibitors may be used as adjuvant therapy instead of tamoxifen or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen use.<EOS>
<BOS>For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials to compare them to hormone therapy with tamoxifen.<EOS>
<BOS>Other types of hormone therapy include megestrol acetate or antiestrogen therapy such as fulvestrant.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cyclindependent kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors are types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies may be used in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Types of monoclonal antibody therapy include the following: Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2, which sends growth signals to breast cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>It may be used with other therapies to treat HER2 positive breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may be combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy to treat breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>It may be used to treat certain patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body).<EOS>
<BOS>It may also be used as neoadjuvant therapy in certain patients with early stage HER2 positive breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Adotrastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody linked to an anticancer drug.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called an antibodydrug conjugate.<EOS>
<BOS>It is used to treat HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors include the following: Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the effects of the HER2 protein and other proteins inside tumor cells.<EOS>
<BOS>It may be used with other drugs to treat patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with trastuzumab.<EOS>
<BOS>Cyclindependent kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block proteins called cyclindependent kinases, which cause the growth of cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Cyclindependent kinase inhibitors include the following: Palbociclib is a cyclindependent kinase inhibitor used with the drug letrozole to treat breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative and has spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>It is used in postmenopausal women whose cancer has not been treated with hormone therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Palbociclib may also be used with fulvestrant in women whose disease has gotten worse after treatment with hormone therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Ribociclib is a cyclindependent kinase inhibitor used with letrozole to treat breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative and has come back or spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>It is used in postmenopausal women whose cancer has not been treated with hormone therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>mTOR inhibitors include the following: Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor used in postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer that is also HER2 negative and has not gotten better with other treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block DNA repair and may cause cancer cells to die.<EOS>
<BOS>PARP inhibitor therapy is being studied for the treatment of patients with triple negative breast cancer or tumors with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.<EOS>
<BOS>After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Studies have shown that highdose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant does not work better than standard chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Doctors have decided that, for now, highdose chemotherapy should be tested only in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Before taking part in such a trial, women should talk with their doctors about the serious side effects, including death, that may be caused by highdose chemotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments for breast cancer may cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>These are called late effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of radiation therapy are not common, but may include: Inflammation of the lung after radiation therapy to the breast, especially when chemotherapy is given at the same time.<EOS>
<BOS>Arm lymphedema, especially when radiation therapy is given after lymph node dissection.<EOS>
<BOS>In women younger than 45 years who receive radiation therapy to the chest wall after mastectomy, there may be a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of chemotherapy depend on the drugs used, but may include: Heart failure.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood clots.<EOS>
<BOS>Premature menopause.<EOS>
<BOS>Second cancer, such as leukemia.<EOS>
<BOS>Late effects of targeted therapy with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or pertuzumab may include: Heart problems such as heart failure.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options for Breast Cancer Early, Localized, or Operable Breast Cancer Treatment of early, localized, or operable breast cancer may include the following: Surgery Breastconserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection may be done.<EOS>

<BOS>Men with breast cancer usually have lumps that can be felt.<EOS>
<BOS>Lumps and other signs may be caused by male breast cancer or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your doctor if you notice a change in your breasts.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for male breast cancer: Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) Stage I Stage II Stage IIIA Stage IIIB Stage IIIC Stage IV After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>This process is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Breast cancer in men is staged the same as it is in women.<EOS>
<BOS>The spread of cancer from the breast to lymph nodes and other parts of the body appears to be similar in men and women.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for male breast cancer: This section describes the stages of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The breast cancer stage is based on the results of testing that is done on the tumor and lymph nodes removed during surgery and other tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) There are 3 types of breast carcinoma in situ: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct.<EOS>
<BOS>The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast.<EOS>
<BOS>In some cases, DCIS may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues.<EOS>
<BOS>At this time, there is no way to know which lesions could become invasive.<EOS>
<BOS>Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the nipple only.<EOS>
<BOS>Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lobules of the breast.<EOS>
<BOS>This condition has not been seen in men.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I In stage I, cancer has formed.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IA, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has not spread outside the breast.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IB, small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.<EOS>
<BOS>2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes and either: no tumor is found in the breast; or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIA no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer (larger than 2 millimeters) is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIB, the tumor is: larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.<EOS>
<BOS>2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIA In stage IIIA: no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer is found in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during imaging tests or a physical exam); or the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.<EOS>
<BOS>2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIB In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and cancer has spread to the chest wall and/or to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, cancer may have spread to : up to 9 axillary lymph nodes; or the lymph nodes near the breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>See the section on Inflammatory Male Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIC In stage IIIC, no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may have spread to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer and/or has spread to the chest wall.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, cancer has spread to: 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; or lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or axillary lymph nodes and lymph nodes near the breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>See the section on Inflammatory Male Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>For treatment, stage IIIC breast cancer is divided into operable and inoperable stage IIIC.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body.<EOS>

<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some procedures may expose the unborn baby to harmful radiation or dyes.<EOS>
<BOS>These procedures are done only if absolutely necessary.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain actions can be taken to expose the unborn baby to as little radiation as possible, such as the use of a leadlined shield to cover the abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used to stage breast cancer during pregnancy: Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery.<EOS>

<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>The picture can be printed to be looked at later.<EOS>

<BOS>In stage IB, small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.<EOS>
<BOS>2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes and either: no tumor is found in the breast; or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIA: no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer (larger than 2 millimeters) is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>In stage IIB, the tumor is: larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.<EOS>
<BOS>2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIA In stage IIIA: no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer is found in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during imaging tests or a physical exam); or the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.<EOS>
<BOS>2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy).<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIB In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and cancer has spread to the chest wall and/or to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, cancer may have spread to: up to 9 axillary lymph nodes; or the lymph nodes near the breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIC In stage IIIC, no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may have spread to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer and/or has spread to the chest wall.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, cancer has spread to: 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; or lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or axillary lymph nodes and lymph nodes near the breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>For treatment, stage IIIC breast cancer is divided into operable and inoperable stage IIIC.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following are risk factors for breast cancer: Older age A personal history of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease Inherited risk of breast cancer Dense breasts Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made in the body Taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause Radiation therapy to the breast or chest Obesity Drinking alcohol The following are protective factors for breast cancer: Less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body Taking estrogenonly hormone therapy after hysterectomy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors and inactivators Estrogenonly hormone therapy after hysterectomy Selective estrogen receptor modulators Aromatase inhibitors and inactivators Riskreducing mastectomy Ovarian ablation Getting enough exercise It is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer: Oral contraceptives Environment Studies have shown that some factors do not affect the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise.<EOS>
<BOS>Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>NCI's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool uses a woman's risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90.<EOS>
<BOS>This online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider.<EOS>
<BOS>For more information on breast cancer risk, call 18004CANCER.<EOS>
<BOS>The following are risk factors for breast cancer: Older age Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers.<EOS>
<BOS>The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.<EOS>
<BOS>A personal history of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease Women with any of the following have an increased risk of breast cancer: A personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).<EOS>
<BOS>A personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Inherited risk of breast cancer Women with a family history of breast cancer in a firstdegree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) have an increased risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Women who have inherited changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes or in certain other genes have a higher risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of breast cancer caused by inherited gene changes depends on the type of gene mutation, family history of cancer, and other factors.<EOS>
<BOS>Dense breasts Having breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram is a factor in breast cancer risk.<EOS>
<BOS>The level of risk depends on how dense the breast tissue is.<EOS>
<BOS>Women with very dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with low breast density.<EOS>
<BOS>Increased breast density is often an inherited trait, but it may also occur in women who have not had children, have a first pregnancy late in life, take postmenopausal hormones, or drink alcohol.<EOS>
<BOS>Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made in the body Estrogen is a hormone made by the body.<EOS>
<BOS>It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to estrogen over a long time may increase the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Estrogen levels are highest during the years a woman is menstruating.<EOS>
<BOS>A woman's exposure to estrogen is increased in the following ways: Early menstruation: Beginning to have menstrual periods at age 11 or younger increases the number of years the breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.<EOS>
<BOS>Starting menopause at a later age: The more years a woman menstruates, the longer her breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.<EOS>
<BOS>Older age at first birth or never having given birth: Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, breast tissue is exposed to more estrogen in women who become pregnant for the first time after age 35 or who never become pregnant.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause Hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, can be made into a pill form in a laboratory.<EOS>
<BOS>Estrogen, progestin, or both may be given to replace the estrogen no longer made by the ovaries in postmenopausal women or women who have had their ovaries removed.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or hormone therapy (HT).<EOS>
<BOS>Combination HRT/HT is estrogen combined with progestin.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of HRT/HT increases the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Studies show that when women stop taking estrogen combined with progestin, the risk of breast cancer decreases.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy to the breast or chest Radiation therapy to the chest for the treatment of cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, starting 10 years after treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of breast cancer depends on the dose of radiation and the age at which it is given.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk is highest if radiation treatment was used during puberty, when breasts are forming.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy to treat cancer in one breast does not appear to increase the risk of cancer in the other breast.<EOS>
<BOS>For women who have inherited changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, exposure to radiation, such as that from chest xrays, may further increase the risk of breast cancer, especially in women who were xrayed before 20 years of age.<EOS>
<BOS>Obesity Obesity increases the risk of breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women who have not used hormone replacement therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Drinking alcohol Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The level of risk rises as the amount of alcohol consumed rises.<EOS>
<BOS>The following are protective factors for breast cancer: Less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body Decreasing the length of time a woman's breast tissue is exposed to estrogen may help prevent breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Exposure to estrogen is reduced in the following ways: Early pregnancy: Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy.<EOS>
<BOS>Women who have a fullterm pregnancy before age 20 have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have not had children or who give birth to their first child after age 35.<EOS>
<BOS>Breastfeeding: Estrogen levels may remain lower while a woman is breastfeeding.<EOS>
<BOS>Women who breastfed have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have had children but did not breastfeed.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking estrogenonly hormone therapy after hysterectomy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors and inactivators Estrogenonly hormone therapy after hysterectomy Hormone therapy with estrogen only may be given to women who have had a hysterectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>In these women, estrogenonly therapy after menopause may decrease the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There is an increased risk of stroke and heart and blood vessel disease in postmenopausal women who take estrogen after a hysterectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>Selective estrogen receptor modulators Tamoxifen and raloxifene belong to the family of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).<EOS>
<BOS>SERMs act like estrogen on some tissues in the body, but block the effect of estrogen on other tissues.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment with tamoxifen lowers the risk of estrogen receptorpositive (ERpositive) breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ in premenopausal and postmenopausal women at high risk.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment with raloxifene also lowers the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.<EOS>
<BOS>With either drug, the reduced risk lasts for several years or longer after treatment is stopped.<EOS>
<BOS>Lower rates of broken bones have been noted in patients taking raloxifene.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking tamoxifen increases the risk of hot flashes, endometrial cancer, stroke, cataracts, and blood clots (especially in the lungs and legs).<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of having these problems increases markedly in women older than 50 years compared with younger women.<EOS>
<BOS>Women younger than 50 years who have a high risk of breast cancer may benefit the most from taking tamoxifen.<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of having these problems decreases after tamoxifen is stopped.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots in the lungs and legs, but does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (decreased bone density), raloxifene lowers the risk of breast cancer for women who have a high or low risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not known if raloxifene would have the same effect in women who do not have osteoporosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.<EOS>
<BOS>Other SERMs are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Aromatase inhibitors and inactivators Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole) and inactivators (exemestane) lower the risk of recurrence and of new breast cancers in women who have a history of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Aromatase inhibitors also decrease the risk of breast cancer in women with the following conditions: Postmenopausal women with a personal history of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Women with no personal history of breast cancer who are 60 years and older, have a history of ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy, or have a high risk of breast cancer based on the Gail model tool (a tool used to estimate the risk of breast cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>In women with an increased risk of breast cancer, taking aromatase inhibitors decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Before menopause, estrogen is made by the ovaries and other tissues in a woman's body, including the brain, fat tissue, and skin.<EOS>
<BOS>After menopause, the ovaries stop making estrogen, but the other tissues do not.<EOS>
<BOS>Aromatase inhibitors block the action of an enzyme called aromatase, which is used to make all of the body's estrogen.<EOS>
<BOS>Aromatase inactivators stop the enzyme from working.<EOS>
<BOS>Possible harms from taking aromatase inhibitors include muscle and joint pain, osteoporosis, hot flashes, and feeling very tired.<EOS>
<BOS>Riskreducing mastectomy Some women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a riskreducing mastectomy (the removal of both breasts when there are no signs of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>The risk of breast cancer is much lower in these women and most feel less anxious about their risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>However, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling about the different ways to prevent breast cancer before making this decision.<EOS>
<BOS>Ovarian ablation The ovaries make most of the estrogen that is made by the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatments that stop or lower the amount of estrogen made by the ovaries include surgery to remove the ovaries, radiation therapy, or taking certain drugs.<EOS>
<BOS>This is called ovarian ablation.<EOS>
<BOS>Premenopausal women who have a high risk of breast cancer due to certain changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may choose to have a riskreducing oophorectomy (the removal of both ovaries when there are no signs of cancer).<EOS>
<BOS>This decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body and lowers the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Riskreducing oophorectomy also lowers the risk of breast cancer in normal premenopausal women and in women with an increased risk of breast cancer due to radiation to the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>However, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling before making this decision.<EOS>
<BOS>The sudden drop in estrogen levels may cause the symptoms of menopause to begin.<EOS>
<BOS>These include hot flashes, trouble sleeping, anxiety, and depression.<EOS>
<BOS>Longterm effects include decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, and decreased bone density.<EOS>
<BOS>Getting enough exercise Women who exercise four or more hours a week have a lower risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The effect of exercise on breast cancer risk may be greatest in premenopausal women who have normal or low body weight.<EOS>
<BOS>It is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer: Oral contraceptives Certain oral contraceptives contain estrogen.<EOS>
<BOS>Some studies have shown that taking oral contraceptives ("the pill") may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in current users.<EOS>
<BOS>This risk decreases over time.<EOS>
<BOS>Other studies have not shown an increased risk of breast cancer in women who take oral contraceptives.<EOS>
<BOS>Progestin only contraceptives that are injected or implanted do not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>More studies are needed to know whether progestinonly oral contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Environment Studies have not proven that being exposed to certain substances in the environment, such as chemicals, increases the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Studies have shown that some factors do not affect the risk of breast cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following do not affect the risk of breast cancer: Having an abortion.<EOS>
<BOS>Making diet changes such as eating less fat or more fruits and vegetables.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking vitamins, including fenretinide (a type of vitamin A).<EOS>
<BOS>Cigarette smoking, both active and passive (inhaling secondhand smoke).<EOS>
<BOS>Using underarm deodorant or antiperspirant.<EOS>
<BOS>Taking statins (cholesterol lowering drugs).<EOS>
<BOS>Taking bisphosphonates (drugs used to treat osteoporosis and hypercalcemia) by mouth or by intravenous infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>These may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.<EOS>
<BOS>New ways to prevent breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation may increase the risk of skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and having skin that is sensitive to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun.<EOS>
<BOS>Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.<EOS>
<BOS>Nonmelanoma skin cancer risk factors include: Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a fair complexion, which includes the following: Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.<EOS>
<BOS>Blue or green or other lightcolored eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>Red or blond hair.<EOS>
<BOS>Having actinic keratosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Past treatment with radiation.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a weakened immune system.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to arsenic.<EOS>
<BOS>Melanoma skin cancer risk factors include: Having a fair complexion, which includes the following: Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.<EOS>
<BOS>Blue or green or other lightcolored eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>Red or blond hair.<EOS>
<BOS>Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.<EOS>
<BOS>Having several large or many small moles.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).<EOS>
<BOS>Having a family or personal history of melanoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Being white.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include bone pain and a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.<EOS>
<BOS>The most common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by neuroblastoma or by other conditions.<EOS>
<BOS>Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following: Lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.<EOS>
<BOS>Bulging eyes.<EOS>
<BOS>Dark circles around the eyes ("black eyes").<EOS>
<BOS>Bone pain.<EOS>
<BOS>Swollen stomach and trouble breathing (in infants).<EOS>
<BOS>Painless, bluish lumps under the skin (in infants).<EOS>
<BOS>Weakness or paralysis (loss of ability to move a body part).<EOS>
<BOS>Less common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include the following: Fever.<EOS>
<BOS>Shortness of breath.<EOS>
<BOS>Feeling tired.<EOS>
<BOS>Easy bruising or bleeding.<EOS>
<BOS>Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).<EOS>
<BOS>High blood pressure.<EOS>
<BOS>Severe watery diarrhea.<EOS>
<BOS>Horner syndrome (droopy eyelid, smaller pupil, and less sweating on one side of the face).<EOS>
<BOS>Jerky muscle movements.<EOS>
<BOS>Uncontrolled eye movements.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for nonsmall cell lung cancer: Occult (hidden) stage Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) Stage I Stage II Stage IIIA Stage IIIB Stage IV After lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests used to diagnose nonsmall cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease.<EOS>
<BOS>(See the General Information section.<EOS>
<BOS>) Other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain and abdomen, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.<EOS>
<BOS>The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.<EOS>
<BOS>Radionuclide bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.<EOS>
<BOS>Pulmonary function test (PFT): A test to see how well the lungs are working.<EOS>
<BOS>It measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>It also measures how much oxygen is used and how much carbon dioxide is given off during breathing.<EOS>
<BOS>This is also called lung function test.<EOS>
<BOS>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body.<EOS>
<BOS>An endoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.<EOS>
<BOS>The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called endosonography.<EOS>
<BOS>EUS may be used to guide fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung, lymph nodes, or other areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>A mediastinoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anterior mediastinotomy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>An incision (cut) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>A mediastinoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This is also called the Chamberlain procedure.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if nonsmall cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually lung cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic lung cancer, not brain cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following stages are used for nonsmall cell lung cancer: Occult (hidden) stage In the occult (hidden) stage, cancer cannot be seen by imaging or bronchoscopy.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells are found in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) or bronchial washing (a sample of cells taken from inside the airways that lead to the lung).<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may have spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the airways.<EOS>
<BOS>These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I In stage I, cancer has formed.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB: Stage IA: The tumor is in the lung only and is 3 centimeters or smaller.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IB: Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true: The tumor is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.<EOS>
<BOS>Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIA and IIB are each divided into two sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIA: (1) Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The lymph nodes with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, one or more of the following is true: The tumor is not larger than 5 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.<EOS>
<BOS>Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>or (2) Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true: The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but not larger than 7 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.<EOS>
<BOS>Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIB: (1) Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The lymph nodes with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Also, one or more of the following is true: The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but not larger than 7 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.<EOS>
<BOS>Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.<EOS>
<BOS>or (2) Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true: The tumor is larger than 7 centimeters.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the main bronchus (and is less than 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus), the chest wall, the diaphragm, or the nerve that controls the diaphragm.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to the membrane around the heart or lining the chest wall.<EOS>
<BOS>The whole lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung).<EOS>
<BOS>There are one or more separate tumors in the same lobe of the lung.<EOS>
<BOS>Stage IIIA Stage IIIA is divided into three sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and which lymph nodes have cancer (if any).<EOS>
<BOS>(1) Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor.<EOS>

<BOS>Stage IV In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>One or more of the following is true: There are one or more tumors in both lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer is found in fluid around the lungs or the heart.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, or bone.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests and procedures that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage small cell lung cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.<EOS>
<BOS>A history of the patients health habits, including smoking, and past jobs, illnesses, and treatments will also be taken.<EOS>
<BOS>Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time.<EOS>
<BOS>Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan (CAT scan) of the brain, chest, and abdomen : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>Sputum cytology : A microscope is used to check for cancer cells in the sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs).<EOS>
<BOS>Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The different ways a biopsy can be done include the following: Fineneedle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung: The removal of tissue or fluid from the lung, using a thin needle.<EOS>
<BOS>A CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging procedure is used to find the abnormal tissue or fluid in the lung.<EOS>
<BOS>A small incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid.<EOS>
<BOS>A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>A chest xray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>Bronchoscopy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs.<EOS>
<BOS>A bronchoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Thoracoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a thoracoscope is inserted into the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>A thoracoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung.<EOS>
<BOS>If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes cant be reached, a thoracotomy may be done.<EOS>
<BOS>In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened.<EOS>
<BOS>Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas.<EOS>
<BOS>An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest.<EOS>
<BOS>A mediastinoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<EOS>
<BOS>It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and highpowered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of developing parathyroid cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for parathyroid cancer include the following rare disorders that are inherited (passed down from parent to child): Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP).<EOS>
<BOS>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment with radiation therapy may increase the risk of developing a parathyroid adenoma.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points After parathyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>There is no standard staging process for parathyroid cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>After parathyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging.<EOS>
<BOS>The following imaging tests may be used to determine if cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs, liver, bone, heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes: CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.<EOS>
<BOS>The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine.<EOS>
<BOS>A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if parathyroid cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually parathyroid cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic parathyroid cancer, not lung cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There is no standard staging process for parathyroid cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Parathyroid cancer is described as either localized or metastatic: Localized parathyroid cancer is found in a parathyroid gland and may have spread to nearby tissues.<EOS>
<BOS>Metastatic parathyroid cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bone, sac around the heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.<EOS>
<BOS>Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine or frequent urination.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.<EOS>
<BOS>Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.<EOS>
<BOS>The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system.<EOS>
<BOS>It lies just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine).<EOS>
<BOS>It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder).<EOS>
<BOS>The prostate gland makes fluid that is part of the semen.<EOS>
<BOS>Prostate cancer is most common in older men.<EOS>
<BOS>In the U.<EOS>
<BOS>S.<EOS>
<BOS>, about 1 out of 5 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Seven types of standard treatment are used: Watchful waiting or active surveillance Surgery Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy Hormone therapy Chemotherapy Biologic therapy Bisphosphonate therapy There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Cryosurgery Highintensityfocused ultrasound therapy Proton beam radiation therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Seven types of standard treatment are used: Watchful waiting or active surveillance Watchful waiting and active surveillance are treatments used for older men who do not have signs or symptoms or have other medical conditions and for men whose prostate cancer is found during a screening test.<EOS>
<BOS>Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment is given to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.<EOS>
<BOS>Active surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results.<EOS>
<BOS>It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse.<EOS>
<BOS>In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including digital rectal exam, PSA test, transrectal ultrasound, and transrectal needle biopsy, to check if the cancer is growing.<EOS>
<BOS>When the cancer begins to grow, treatment is given to cure the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Other terms that are used to describe not giving treatment to cure prostate cancer right after diagnosis are observation, watch and wait, and expectant management.<EOS>
<BOS>Surgery Patients in good health whose tumor is in the prostate gland only may be treated with surgery to remove the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>The following types of surgery are used: Radical prostatectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate, surrounding tissue, and seminal vesicles.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radical prostatectomy: Retropubic prostatectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate through an incision (cut) in the abdominal wall.<EOS>
<BOS>Removal of nearby lymph nodes may be done at the same time.<EOS>
<BOS>Perineal prostatectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate through an incision (cut) made in the perineum (area between the scrotum and anus).<EOS>
<BOS>Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed through a separate incision in the abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>Pelvic lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the pelvis.<EOS>
<BOS>A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>If the lymph nodes contain cancer, the doctor will not remove the prostate and may recommend other treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): A surgical procedure to remove tissue from the prostate using a resectoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool) inserted through the urethra.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is done to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy and it is sometimes done to relieve symptoms caused by a tumor before other cancer treatment is given.<EOS>
<BOS>TURP may also be done in men whose tumor is in the prostate only and who cannot have a radical prostatectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>In some cases, nervesparing surgery can be done.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of surgery may save the nerves that control erection.<EOS>
<BOS>However, men with large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves may not be able to have this surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Possible problems after prostate cancer surgery include the following: Impotence.<EOS>
<BOS>Leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum.<EOS>
<BOS>Shortening of the penis (1 to 2 centimeters).<EOS>
<BOS>The exact reason for this is not known.<EOS>
<BOS>Inguinal hernia (bulging of fat or part of the small intestine through weak muscles into the groin).<EOS>
<BOS>Inguinal hernia may occur more often in men treated with radical prostatectomy than in men who have some other types of prostate surgery, radiation therapy, or prostate biopsy alone.<EOS>
<BOS>It is most likely to occur within the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Conformal radiation is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3dimensional (3D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>Hypofractionated radiation therapy may be given because it has a more convenient treatment schedule.<EOS>
<BOS>Hypofractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which a larger than usual total dose of radiation is given once a day over a shorter period of time (fewer days) compared to standard radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Hypofractionated radiation therapy may have worse side effects than standard radiation therapy, depending on the schedules used.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>In earlystage prostate cancer, the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate using needles that are inserted through the skin between the scrotum and rectum.<EOS>
<BOS>The placement of the radioactive seeds in the prostate is guided by images from transrectal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT).<EOS>
<BOS>The needles are removed after the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiopharmaceutical therapy uses a radioactive substance to treat cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiopharmaceutical therapy includes the following: Alpha emitter radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>A radioactive substance called radium223 is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>The radium223 collects in areas of bone with cancer and kills the cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical therapy are used to treat prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Men treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of having bladder and/or gastrointestinal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy can cause impotence and urinary problems.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.<EOS>
<BOS>In prostate cancer, male sex hormones can cause prostate cancer to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Drugs, surgery, or other hormones are used to reduce the amount of male hormones or block them from working.<EOS>
<BOS>Hormone therapy for prostate cancer may include the following: Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists can stop the testicles from making testosterone.<EOS>
<BOS>Examples are leuprolide, goserelin, and buserelin.<EOS>
<BOS>Antiandrogens can block the action of androgens (hormones that promote male sex characteristics), such as testosterone.<EOS>
<BOS>Examples are flutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and nilutamide.<EOS>
<BOS>Drugs that can prevent the adrenal glands from making androgens include ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide.<EOS>
<BOS>Orchiectomy is a surgical procedure to remove one or both testicles, the main source of male hormones, such as testosterone, to decrease the amount of hormone being made.<EOS>
<BOS>Estrogens (hormones that promote female sex characteristics) can prevent the testicles from making testosterone.<EOS>
<BOS>However, estrogens are seldom used today in the treatment of prostate cancer because of the risk of serious side effects.<EOS>
<BOS>Hot flashes, impaired sexual function, loss of desire for sex, and weakened bones may occur in men treated with hormone therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Other side effects include diarrhea, nausea, and itching.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>SipuleucelT is a type of biologic therapy used to treat prostate cancer that has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body).<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Bisphosphonate therapy Bisphosphonate drugs, such as clodronate or zoledronate, reduce bone disease when cancer has spread to the bone.<EOS>
<BOS>Men who are treated with antiandrogen therapy or orchiectomy are at an increased risk of bone loss.<EOS>
<BOS>In these men, bisphosphonate drugs lessen the risk of bone fracture (breaks).<EOS>
<BOS>The use of bisphosphonate drugs to prevent or slow the growth of bone metastases is being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and certain types of hormone therapy can weaken bones and lead to bone pain.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatments for bone pain include the following: Pain medicine.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Strontium89 (a radioisotope).<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody, such as denosumab.<EOS>
<BOS>Bisphosphonate therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Corticosteroids.<EOS>
<BOS>See the PDQ summary on Pain for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>It may not mention every new treatment being studied.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Cryosurgery Cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy prostate cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Ultrasound is used to find the area that will be treated.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Cryosurgery can cause impotence and leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum.<EOS>
<BOS>Highintensityfocused ultrasound therapy Highintensityfocused ultrasound therapy is a treatment that uses ultrasound (highenergy sound waves) to destroy cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>To treat prostate cancer, an endorectal probe is used to make the sound waves.<EOS>
<BOS>Proton beam radiation therapy Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of highenergy, external radiation therapy that targets tumors with streams of protons (small, positively charged particles).<EOS>
<BOS>This type of radiation therapy is being studied in the treatment of prostate cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>

<BOS>Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Active surveillance Targeted therapy Other types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>There are different types of treatment for patients with rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Different types of treatment are available for patients with rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery is the most common treatment for all stages of rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer is removed using one of the following types of surgery: Polypectomy: If the cancer is found in a polyp (a small piece of bulging tissue), the polyp is often removed during a colonoscopy.<EOS>
<BOS>Local excision: If the cancer is found on the inside surface of the rectum and has not spread into the wall of the rectum, the cancer and a small amount of surrounding healthy tissue is removed.<EOS>
<BOS>Resection: If the cancer has spread into the wall of the rectum, the section of the rectum with cancer and nearby healthy tissue is removed.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes the tissue between the rectum and the abdominal wall is also removed.<EOS>
<BOS>The lymph nodes near the rectum are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed.<EOS>
<BOS>In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia.<EOS>
<BOS>Cryosurgery: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Pelvic exenteration: If the cancer has spread to other organs near the rectum, the lower colon, rectum, and bladder are removed.<EOS>
<BOS>In women, the cervix, vagina, ovaries, and nearby lymph nodes may be removed.<EOS>
<BOS>In men, the prostate may be removed.<EOS>
<BOS>Artificial openings (stoma) are made for urine and stool to flow from the body to a collection bag.<EOS>
<BOS>After the cancer is removed, the surgeon will either: do an anastomosis (sew the healthy parts of the rectum together, sew the remaining rectum to the colon, or sew the colon to the anus); or make a stoma (an opening) from the rectum to the outside of the body for waste to pass through.<EOS>
<BOS>This procedure is done if the cancer is too close to the anus and is called a colostomy.<EOS>
<BOS>A bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste.<EOS>
<BOS>Sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the rectum has healed, and then it can be reversed.<EOS>
<BOS>If the entire rectum is removed, however, the colostomy may be permanent.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor, make it easier to remove the cancer, and help with bowel control after surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Even if all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation is removed, some patients may be given radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.<EOS>
<BOS>Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.<EOS>
<BOS>There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>External radiation therapy is used to treat rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Shortcourse preoperative radiation therapy is used in some types of rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>This treatment uses fewer and lower doses of radiation than standard treatment, followed by surgery several days after the last dose.<EOS>
<BOS>Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).<EOS>
<BOS>Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery is a type of regional chemotherapy that may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>This is done by blocking the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>The livers arteries then carry the drugs into the liver.<EOS>
<BOS>Only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on what is used to block the artery.<EOS>
<BOS>The liver continues to receive some blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.<EOS>
<BOS>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Rectal Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Active surveillance Active surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results.<EOS>
<BOS>It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse.<EOS>
<BOS>In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests to check if the cancer is growing.<EOS>
<BOS>When the cancer begins to grow, treatment is given to cure the cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests include the following: Digital rectal exam.<EOS>
<BOS>MRI.<EOS>
<BOS>Endoscopy.<EOS>
<BOS>Sigmoidoscopy.<EOS>
<BOS>CT scan.<EOS>
<BOS>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay.<EOS>
<BOS>Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of rectal cancer include the following: Monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy being used for the treatment of rectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell.<EOS>
<BOS>These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow.<EOS>
<BOS>The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.<EOS>
<BOS>Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.<EOS>
<BOS>They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).<EOS>
<BOS>This may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Cetuximab and panitumumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of some types of cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>This may stop cancer cells from growing and dividing.<EOS>
<BOS>Angiogenesis inhibitors: Angiogenesis inhibitors stop the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>Zivaflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor trap that blocks an enzyme needed for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors.<EOS>
<BOS>Regorafenib is used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>It blocks the action of certain proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor.<EOS>
<BOS>This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them.<EOS>
<BOS>It may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.<EOS>
<BOS>See Drugs Approved for Rectal Cancer for more information.<EOS>
<BOS>Other types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.<EOS>
<BOS>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.<EOS>
<BOS>Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.<EOS>
<BOS>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.<EOS>
<BOS>There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.<EOS>
<BOS>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.<EOS>
<BOS>See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.<EOS>
<BOS>Followup tests may be needed.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.<EOS>
<BOS>Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working.<EOS>
<BOS>Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.<EOS>
<BOS>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.<EOS>
<BOS>The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).<EOS>
<BOS>These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.<EOS>
<BOS>After treatment for rectal cancer, a blood test to measure amounts of carcinoembryonic antigen (a substance in the blood that may be increased when cancer is present) may be done to see if the cancer has come back.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment Options by Stage Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) Treatment of stage 0 may include the following: Simple polypectomy.<EOS>

<BOS>Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting colorectal cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.<EOS>
<BOS>For information about risk factors and protective factors for colorectal cancer, see the PDQ summary on Colorectal Cancer Prevention.<EOS>
<BOS>Diet and health history can affect the risk of developing small intestine cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor.<EOS>
<BOS>Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.<EOS>
<BOS>Risk factors for small intestine cancer include the following: Eating a highfat diet.<EOS>
<BOS>Having Crohn disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Having celiac disease.<EOS>
<BOS>Having familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).<EOS>
<BOS>Key Points Tests and procedures to stage small intestine cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Small intestine cancer is grouped according to whether or not the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Tests and procedures to stage small intestine cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.<EOS>
<BOS>Staging is used to find out how far the cancer has spread, but treatment decisions are not based on stage.<EOS>
<BOS>See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to detect, diagnose, and stage small intestine cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis.<EOS>
<BOS>Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.<EOS>
<BOS>Lymph system.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>Blood.<EOS>
<BOS>The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.<EOS>
<BOS>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.<EOS>
<BOS>For example, if small intestine cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually small intestine cancer cells.<EOS>
<BOS>The disease is metastatic small intestine cancer, not liver cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>Small intestine cancer is grouped according to whether or not the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.<EOS>
<BOS>Treatment depends on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the cancer is being treated as a primary tumor or is metastatic cancer.<EOS>
<BOS>New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.<EOS>
