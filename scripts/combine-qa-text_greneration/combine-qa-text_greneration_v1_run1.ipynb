Cancer that has spread within the vulva to other parts of the body is called seminoma. A biopsy is done to diagnose seminoma. A biopsy is done during surgery to remove the tumor. Sometimes, a small incision (cut) is made in the vulva and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into it. The doctor will usually remove the tumor and a small amount of tissue, after the doctor has removed all the cancer. The tissue sample is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more tissue. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body through organs and tissues. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood\n",
